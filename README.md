# GitHub User Repo Interactions
Analysis of connection of users on GitHub, by examining their interactions with repositories.



## Data
We will use data from [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/), which "provides 20+ event types, which range from new commits and fork events, to opening new tickets, commenting, and adding members to a project. These events are aggregated into hourly archives, which you can access with any HTTP client".
