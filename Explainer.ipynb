    "#### Wowhead comments\n",
    "The goal here was to find some augmenting data from Wowhead users for the characters we extracted from the Wikipages. It became apparent that multiple NPCs exist in-game for every character (for technical reasons, etc.), and as a consequence of this, there are multiple Wowhead NPC pages for every Wikipage character.\n",
    "\n",
    "By hopping around on Wowhead for a bit, we discovered that they have a search page for NPCs which allowed filtering. Thus, we quickly set up a procedure for calling this endpoint with the filter `Has comments` set to `Yes`. Additionally, the search page seemed to fuzzily match the names from the Wikipage characters, but it was not completely resilient to discrepancies (e.g. `Thoras Trollbane` will find some pages, but `Thoras Trollbaen` will not. The search results were embedded in the page as `<div>` elements with a certain *id* attribute. This is where `beautifulsoup` came in handy. It enables you to parse HTML text data into a virtual DOM structure, which allows for more resilient scraping than pure regular expressions can provide. After some DOM and text manipulation, the links to the NPC pages are now extracted for every character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every NPC page on Wowhead, we needed to scrape the user comments. Luckily, these seemed to be embedded in the NPC pages themselves in a certain `<script>` element. Conveniently, the comment data is already formatted as JSON and can be directly extracted and saved. We save the comments a `.njson` format, which is simply newline-delimited JSON (i.e. every line of the file parses as its own JSON object).\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire procedure of taking Wikipage character names and outputting Wowhead comments is defined in the script `download_character_comments.py`. We also added a timeout to the script to avoid making too many requests to Wowhead and getting blacklisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The comment text data needed to be cleaned before we could use it for analysis, however. Thus, we created a few regular expressions to help clean up the comment texts:\n",
    "* `re.sub(r\"\\[.+?\\]\", \"\", t)`\n",
    "    * For instance, the comments would often include hyperlinks to other Wowhead pages, e.g. `\"You need to complete [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10588]Cipher of Damnation[/url] first.\"`. This regular expression finds pairs of brackets `[` and `]` with 1 or more character between them, and matches them lazily (i.e. as few chars as possible). Thus, the result of the example would be  `\"You need to complete Cipher of Damnation first.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `re.sub(r\"(\\\\r|\\\\n|\\\\t)+\", \" \", t)`\n",
    "    * Users also seemed to write out their comments using several lines. This means that a lot of carriage returns, newlines were present in the raw texts, e.g. `\"I say this guy becomes boss lvl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter experiencing the ...\"`. These sequences of spacing characters could be replaced with a simple space character. As such, we created a regular expression which finds all sequences of 1 or more consecutive \\r, \\n or \\t characters and replaces them with a single space character.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `re.findall(r\"(.+?(?:[!.?]+|$))(?:\\s|$)\", t)`\n",
    "    * Depending on how the text is to be analyzed, it can be useful to split a text blob into its individual sentences. The above expression lazily finds all sequences of characters that are followed by 1 or more sentence delimiter characters (i.e. . or !) or the end of sequence, which are subsequently followed by either a space or the end of the sequence. It seems to work better for our use case than `sent_tokenize` from the `nltk` package.\n",

    "The goal for this section is to produce a unidimensional sentiment score for some input text (be it a Wowhead comment, or a Wikipages quote). The idea is that performing this analysis will provide a new perspective on the data in our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sentiment analysis part to be carried out, we needed some text to analyze first. Here, we chose to work with text from the scraped Wowhead comments, and with text from the extracted quotes from the Wikipages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose two different methods for performing the sentiment analysis:\n",
    "* [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)\n",
    "    * VADER is a dictionary- and rule-based approach to evaluating text sentiment. This means that under the hood, VADER has a lookup table which is used to assign sentiment scores to tokens individually. However, it has rules which alter the sentiment vaules based on negations, various punctuations, degree modifiers (e.g. *very* or *somewhat*), slang words, emojis, and much more. Furthermore, it should be noted that VADER is specifically tuned for text from social media. The VADER dictionary (or lexicon, as they call it) consists of about 7500 tokens. VADER produces several dimensions for sentiment, but the `compound` dimensions is stated as being the best unidimensional measure of sentiment (it is described as a \"normalized, weighted composite score\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* [BERT (flairNLP)](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)\n",
    "    * This approach is based on BERT (which is a deep learning technique for natural language modeling). It works by breaking down the input text into tokens, and assigning an embedding to every token. These embeddings are then combined in a manner which takes context/sequence into account (through *attention* mechanisms) and produces a single embedding for the entire input text. Classification can then be performed on this resulting vector, which turns it into a sentiment score (either positive/negative). What is noteworthy about this approach is its ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequences, and its large vocabulary size (this depends of the specific BERT variant, but is mostly in the scope of ~30K different tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The VADER procedure is carried out as follows:\n",
    "1. Break down input text into individual sentences (using previously described regex)\n",
    "2. For every sentence, we pass it to VADER's `polarity_scores(...)` method and retrieve its `compound` score\n",
    "3. Reduce all sentences to a single score by averaging them, and return it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The BERT procedure is carried out as follows:\n",
    "1. Pass the input text directly to flair by creating a `flair.data.Sentence(...)` and subsequently calling `.predict(...)` on it\n",
    "2. The output is converted from two-class [0,1] scores to a single continuum ranging from [-1, 1] by multiplying the class score by -1 if the predicted class is `NEGATIVE`\n",
    "3. Return the converted score\n",
    "\n",
    "With the two procedures in place, we can look at how the models compare for a couple of examples:\n",
    "* E\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it would be interesting to see how the VADER sentiment scores compare to the BERT scores. To do this, we can take the two scores for all comments and wikipedia quotes, and plot the following histograms:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sentiment distributions](visualizations/sentdist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is immediately apparent that the two methods produce significantly different scores for the text data we extracted. The VADER scores are very dense around 0, and very shallow tails, with barely any scores when approaching the minimum and maximum of -1 and 1 respectively. On the other hand, the BERT scores are very heavily distributed towards the minimum and maximum, with more negative scores than negative in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference in score distributions could probably stem from the following facts:\n",
    "* Many out-of-lexicon tokens will lead to a high concentration of 0-scores for the VADER method. The BERT method has a bigger vocabulary, and out-of-vocabulary tokens do not have as big of an impact on this type of model.\n",
    "* The BERT method uses a model which has been trained as a binary classification task. This could lead to a sharp decision boundary of confidence either being 0 or 1.\n"
