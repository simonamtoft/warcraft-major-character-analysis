Strong of arm and keen of mind, Magni loved his two brothers above all else in the world. \n\nHe was one of the heroes during the second war, often directly leading his people into battle.Upon the liberation of Ironforge by the forces of the Alliance he pledged his kingdom's support, his two brothers accompanying the Alliance.  After the Second War, both Brann and Muradin became founding members of the Explorer's League, which was dedicated to uncovering the Titanic heritage of the dwarves.\n\nDuring the fall of Lordaeron, his middle brother Muradin, who had gone to Northrend with the Explorer\u2019s League, seeking a legendary and powerful weapon, was reportedly slain by Prince Arthas in Northrend. Magni was overcome with grief at the news of Muradin's demise, but he and the youngest brother, Brann, remained steadfast in their desire to continue serving the dwarven people.  However, Brann, an explorer of some renown ((and the purported \u201cauthor\u201d of some of Blizzard\u2019s pen and paper RPG guides- [i]Lands of Conflict[/i] and [i]Lands of Mystery[/i])) , went missing several times during the events of World of Warcraft, finally disappearing in Northrend.\n\nMagni has diplomatically approached Stormwind for assistance against the ever increasing Dark Iron threat, citing their destruction and control of the Thandol Span. Much to his frustration, his pleas have fallen on deaf ears, due to the influence of the duplicitous [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=1749]Lady Katrana Prestor[/url]. \n\n[b]SPOILER ALERT[/b]\nAnd to further compound the regent\u2019s troubles, King Magni's only child, [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8929]Moira Bronzebeard[/url], was captured by the Dark Iron [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=9019]Emperor Dagran Thaurissan[/url], and is now under a magical charm spell, serving the evil emperor without question. Thaurissan [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4342#comments]made her fall in love with him[/url], and together, [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4363]they have conceived a child[/url]. Much to the kingdom's despair, Magni's grand heir will apparently be a dwarf who is both the heir of the King of Ironforge and the Emperor of Blackrock.\n[b]END SPOILER[/b]\n\nThough he remains a wise and strong leader, his pain and sorrow weigh heavily upon him. Many dwarves wonder whether the kingdom will ever see another Bronzebeard sitting on the throne of Ironforge and if it does, whether that leader will ever be able to truly carry the legacy borne by its current, embattled King.\n\n[mostly adapted from WoWwiki.

Magni, you have called this meeting.  What concerns you?[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45666]King Magni Bronzebeard[/url]: You've no doubt noticed the string of earthquakes we've had in the last weeks.  Something doesn't feel right about them.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41710]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/url]: What do you mean?[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: We dwarves have a connection to the earth.  We can feel her pain.  And right now the earth is crying out.  These earthquakes... they are both natural and not.  I wanted to gather you all together and discuss them.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45776]Tyrande Whisperwind[/url]: Even in Darnassus we have noticed the earth is at odds with something.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: I've received word from my brother Brann in Northrend.  In his exploring of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/zone=4273]Ulduar[/url] he came across some unusual tablets... something ancient.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Nothing good has come from that dreadful place.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: This might just change your mind.  Brann is shipping the tablets to me as we speak. Preliminary reports from the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Explorers'_League]Explorers' League[/url] state that they may be able to help us understand what is going on with the earthquakes.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45667]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/url]: Our top minds have been looking into the seismic activities... Well, we've mostly been looking at how to secure a building's frame while at the same time simulating tectonic shifts...[/li]\r\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: ...because on the one hand, this could be a handy device, the \"Shake-a-Ton 2000.\"  But on the other hand, the last thing we gnomes want to see is the mountains of Dun Morogh collapse and crush Ironforge.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: So is that why you have moved out?[/li]\r\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: Ha, not at all!  Though it is a striking coincidence.  Gnomeregan has been and continues to shame our people.  It is long past time we reclaim our homeland.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Well, it is good that things have turned out... better for you and your people, High Tinker.  But not all of us have the luxury of up and moving our kingdom.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45774]Prophet Velen[/url]: And those that did know how dangerous these earthquakes can be.  To this day, the Exodar is still shaking from our rather abrupt arrival.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I'm not certain we could organize our people to move even if we wanted to.  We've also received word of hostile elementals appearing randomly across the lands, sometimes in towns, sometimes across the countryside.  Moving may not be an option.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: Well, there is at least a wee bit of good news... no offense, Gelbin.  The shaking seems to have stirred up [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Earthen_Ring]The Earthen Ring[/url].  Even the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=39055]Wildhammer shaman[/url] have offered their help.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Perhaps these events are also what have brought forth the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Highborne]Highborne[/url] from [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Shen%27dralar]Shen'dralar[/url].[/li]\r\n[li][b]Prophet Velen[/b]: It seems as if this world is coming apart at the seams.  I've seen these symptoms before, on Draenor... We may not be able to stop this.  Fleeing may be our best option.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Fleeing is not an option I wish to entertain at this point. We will find another way.  Perhaps these tablets from Ulduar will shed some light on our situation.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: Hopefully we can get these answers quickly.  The [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40125]people[/url] are frightened, and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40124]cultists[/url] are taking advantage of that fear.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: These cultists only exacerbate the problem.  They preach the end of the world, or that the world is having birthing pains... Hyperbole that is hard for the populace to ignore.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Troubling times indeed. Fear of the unknown makes people do foolish things.[/li]\r\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: And our lack of answers only fuels the confusion.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: All the more reason we need to reach the bottom of this.  This tablet from Ulduar will lead us in the right direction.  Brann is sure of it.  And if Brann is certain, then I am certain.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I've made it a point not to argue with a dwarf when it comes to the earth.  If the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Bronzebeard_clan]Bronzebeards[/url] are sure this tablet will help solve the earth's problems, then by all means we should support them.[/li]\r\n[/ul][/quote]", "date": "2010-11-01T20:48:32-05:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
