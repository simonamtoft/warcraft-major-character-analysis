{"commentv2": 1, "number": 1, "id": 407089, "nreplies": 10, "sticky": 0, "user": "shadowspa", "body": "Strategies\r\nPhase One\r\n\r\nDuring Phase One, Malygos is tanked in the center of the room by one tank.\r\n\r\nHis attacks hit hard, but the attack speed is slow. He does arcane breaths for X damage.\r\n\r\nThroughout the fight, power sparks come out of portals outside of the platform, they slowly move to Malygos, and if they hit him his next arcane breath does a VERY HIGH amount of damage, most likely one-shotting your tank. It's important that they are killed before they hit him. When the power sparks are killed, they drop a small aura on the ground that increases your damage done. The aura stacks, so if they all die in that same location, you can get very high hits off.\r\n\r\nTrick: The sparks can be \"pulled\" to your DPS with Death Grip, so it advisable to have a pre-assigned stack location for your raid, and have a Death Knight pull the sparks to that spot. Once pulled they are rootable to keep them in place while you kill them.\r\n\r\nMalygos also uses a cyclone ability that will pull the entire raid into the air and spin them around. He will not attack your tank during this ability, however power sparks will continue to move toward him, make sure you kill them if they are going to get too close to him. Once this ability ends, Malygos will be facing in a random direction and your tank will also be in a random location, so it is vital to move intelligently at this point before he is once again facing your tank, as his breath will one-shot any dps or healers unlucky enough to be in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nNote: Once Malygos reaches 50%, he will slowly take off, however he remains targetable until he reaches his max height, so burn him as best you can while he is taking off.\r\nPhase Two\r\n\r\nPhase Two begins at 50%.\r\n\r\nMalygos himself is not targetable during this phase, it will end when the adds he spawns are all killed. However, he does continue to play a part in the encounter.\r\n\r\nDuring this phase he drops anti-magic zones onto the ground the raid MUST stand inside of, it reduces magical damage taken by 50%. They shrink over time, so it's important that your raid moves to each new one he drops.\r\n\r\nThroughout the phase, he will deep breath doing ~4k damage per second, unless you are standing inside of the anti-magic zone.\r\n\r\nThe way the fight works during this phase is there are NPCs riding around on disks in the room. There are two types of mobs, Lords and Scions. The Lords will move down onto the group, and need to be tanked (They will one-shot a non-tank). After they die, they drop a disk that a raid member can mount onto, which allows them to fly, to attack the Scions that do not come down to the ground. It is recommended to let melee take the first disks, then ranged. As those mobs die, they also drop disks, which allows the rest of your dps to get onto them. The Scions will continually cast Arcane Blast on random targets on the floor, which is mitigated by the anti-magic zones. While mounted on a disk, you will not take damage.\r\n\r\nAfter all of the NPCs riding on the disks die, the players on the disks need to dismount as Phase 3 is about to begin.\r\n\r\nNote: After all the Scions are dead, you will get a short burn period on Malygos before he breaks the floor. Use any DPS increase cooldowns that are available at this time, as you will not be able to use them once you mount your dragon. If executed well you can take an extra 5%-10% off his HP before you enter phase 3.\r\nPhase Three\r\n\r\nPhase Three begins when all of the Scions die (the Lords should be killed first, so they must be killed as well). Malygos destroys the floor of the room, and the raid falls onto dragons.\r\n\r\nThe dragons use combo points and energy sort of like a rogue. The combo points are used for special finishing moves.\r\n\r\nWarning : You are now entering an unclear phase's description, where things may be wrong, and not the correct strategy.\r\n\r\nDuring this phase Malygos does - In Melee Range... Heavy Melee Attacks and Cleaves RangedA high damage ranged ability (The focusing mentioned below)\r\n\r\nThe dragons have 6 abilities:\r\n\r\nFlame Spike\r\n    Damaging fire attack causing 943-1057 fire damage and awarding 1 combo point at the cost of 10 energy. \r\n\r\nEngulf in Flames\r\n    Finishing move which launches a blast of flame igniting target for 1500 fire damage every 3 seconds. The effect can stack and will last longer per combo point up to 22 seconds. Costs 50 energy. \r\n\r\nRevivify\r\n    A HoT that lasts for 10 seconds healing 500 per second and awarding 1 combo point at the cost of 10 energy. \r\n\r\nLife Burst\r\n    Huge healing finishing move which increases the casters healing done by 50% and lasts longer per combo point. Max combo points award a 15k heal over 25 seconds. Costs 50 energy. \r\n\r\nName N/A\r\n    Increases your drake's flight speed by 500%. \r\n\r\nFlame Shield\r\n    Finishing move to protect your drake. Shield surrounds you reducing all damage taken by 80% and lasting up to 6 seconds for max combo points. Costs 25 energy with a 30 second cooldown. \r\n\r\nThough the strategy for this phase is still unclear, it is believed that each player should target themselves and stack up 5 revivifys granting 5 total combo points on themselves, and then they should use Life Burst. eEfore Revivify fades, the player should recast it on themselves, same deal with life burst, but switching targets clears the combo points, so you will need to cast 5 more heals on yourself then life burst before it fades.\r\n\r\nIn between keeping your Hots up you should be Flame Spike spamming malygos, after 5 combo points apply Engulf in Flames, then spam it more times.\r\n\r\nWhenever he sets his \"focus\" to you, it's important that you have 5 combo points on him, and use your shield (hotkey 6). It is believed you can also use the sprint (hotkey 5) and outrange him before he begins channeling.\r\n\r\nNote: Remember to save 25 energy at all times to use your shield. If you are at 0 energy and targeted, you may be killed before you regen enough to use your shield. This is important as threat seems strange for this portion of the encounter and you may be targeted at any time.\r\nThe End\r\n\r\nThen you just burn him until the end of the fight, where Alexstrasza enters and finishes the battle. The loot for the fight comes from Alexstrasza's Gift, the fight rewards two badges.\r\n\r\nThe exit portal respawns, and you can fly over to it. But the floor of the instance does not respawn.\r\n\r\nQuotes\r\n\r\nPre-Fight:\r\n\r\n    * Lesser beings, intruding here! A shame that your excess courage does not compensate for your stupidity!\r\n    * None but the blue dragonflight are welcome here! Perhaps this is the work of Alexstrasza?

Particularly interesting are the words that follow. The human author writes, \"Rarely seen after his retreat to the far north, he is almost always in the form of an insect-like creature, but while in dragon form he, and his flight, are varying blues in color.\" If the account is true, it strongly suggests Malygos lives -- or once lived -- among the Nerubian race of Northrend. \r\n\r\nMalygos has an extraordinary command over magic, and although he is not as powerful physically, his spellcasting more than counters that disadvantage.

If you're running three tanks trying running two tanks instead.  The 25-man version requires you to have four tanked ads meaning that at some point one tank would have to tank at least two ads.  The extra DPS gained means bursting through this encounter easier without meeting the gear requirements.  My guild's first kill almost everyone but me was terribly undergeared, we used one tank (myself) I rounded up all the ads and had people assist off me and watch threat on other ads.\r\n2.  Pre-assign a discs order for P2.  You want to load up as many ranged as possible on this fight but make sure to bring your highest DPS regardless.  In 25-man we have all casters try and DPS the Scions while melee kill the Lords.  Melee go up one at a time in the set order... its a big list.  If you have to choose between a prot warrior going up and a caster you should probably choose the prot warrior the extra sunders added to the scions will help hunters on the groud and melee in the sky.\r\n3.  In phase three have everyone stack on one set location.  I know a lot of strats suggest splitting up groups but if you feel you have 25 competent players they just move right to avoid the AOE dmg, shield themselves from his instagib, and spam their healing/dps buttons.  We use three healers total for this phase freeing up 4 more people to DPS.   If everyone is stacked properly lifeburst heals everyone and there's never a need for any excessive amount of healers.\r\n\r\nIf after this you still can't beat the enrage timer get your lowest dpsers out doing heroics OR look at your debuffs/buffs list and make sure you have them all.", "date": "2008-12-16T11:23:30-06:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Phase 1: double buffing power sparks really cuts phase 1.

I am told 25man is easier.\r\n\r\nHere's a few suggestions for anyone who might be stuck.\r\n\r\nPhase 1:\r\n\r\n-Hits the MT for 11-9k dmg per swing. Melee swing is slow.\r\n-Arcane Breath brings up a huge damage spike and is the potential tank killer. Let your healers be aware.\r\n-The \"gear requirement\" in this fight is NOT a joke. Even with combined spark buffs, we downed him 5 secs after enrage.\r\n\r\nOur raid setup was: 1 tank (me, 30.6k hp unbuffed prot warrior, all 80 epics except for trinkets), 2 healers (CoH priest and resto druid, both over 2k spellpower and huge mp5), and 7 dps (all tried and tested in other raids, well over 3k constant dps).\r\n\r\nHave the entire raid stack on the very middle of the area, while the tank brings Malygos to the edge of the inner ring, right where the outer ring starts.\r\n\r\nThe tank needs to be completely aware of his surroundings to see where sparks come from. When a spark spawns, he needs to kite Malygos around the edge of the inner ring (just follow the line, it's simple) to position him so that the raid is between him and the spark. Assign a ranged dps to bring the spark to 20%-50% and burst it down when it's on top of the raid.\r\n\r\n2 Sparks will come between each Vortex. One right after and one while you fight.\r\n\r\nWhile the raid is in the Vortex, locate any incoming sparks, and have the tank position Malygos immediatly after everyone lands. If done correctly, the raid just has to run to the center after each votex.\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nOn phase 2:\r\n\r\nThe tank takes both Nexus Lords. ALL dps nuke these down first. Don't split the dps, as you need to take the Lords out of the fight asap to reduce the raid's damage intake. The only exceptions are the hunters, who should only attack the Scions on the disks if they can't attack the Nexus Lord due to minimum range.\r\n\r\nIf you're a prot warrior, Improved Spell Reflect will save your raid member's life when running from one anti-magic zone to the next, as you will reflect the Scion's spells. Also useful to help out the healers. Use it on EVERY cooldown if possible, time it so you have it available when people run from bubble to bubble.\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nOn phase 3:\r\n\r\nAll has been pretty much said. Just keep an eye out for the lightning clouds (you'll see Malygos shoot a spark at the grp), stay grouped up, and keep the DoT up.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 is the most difficult to get through, as you have to do itas fast as possible and keep *everyone* alive.\r\n\r\nHope this helped", "date": "2009-01-08T07:00:23-06:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "About healing 10-men version of Maly.

Dragons are very 'close' so to say, they call each other brother and sister because they are equal to each other. Another term dragons might use is 'my brood'. This implies more than just a bond between two dragons, they actually have to be brother and/or sister as we use it, of the same clutch.

In short, Neltharion got corrupted by a great evil (supposedly the Old Gods) he created 'the dragon soul' which later became known as the demon soul. The purpose of this Dragon Soul was to decimate the demonic army razing over Azeroth (This was at the time of the first invasion of the burning legion). Every dragon contributed his or her part into the Dragon Soul. However, the dragons didn't expect so see one of their mightiest turn on them, and Neltharion  used the Dragon Soul to attack the races of Azeroth, trying to defend their home. Then he attacked the dragons with it. When he got distracted by an attack of a lonely dragon the blue dragon flight broke loose of his bounds and tried to contain Neltharion (later known as Deathwing (He'll be the new Cataclysm boss)) Neltharion, using the Demon Soul, decimated the Blue flight, and threw Malygos far over the horizon. Malygos became insane  after seeing his flight decimated, it would take decennia to restore the blue dragon flight to it's former glory.\n\n\nEdit: poster below (Mealstrom) might also spoil War of the Ancients lore in his post", "date": "2010-06-03T10:11:23-05:00", "rating": 17, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-07-19T09:32:25-05:00", 4, "Darkomicron"]}

I was able to solo him all the way to phase 3, but hit enrage just as phase 3 started. With some better gear and a bit more optimal play with sparks it should be possible to get into phase 3 with about 2 minutes left, enough to kill him.\n\nThe fight is -extremely- difficult to solo to that point though. You must get every single spark in order to do enough DPS to get out of phase 1 in a timely manner. A DK is the only class that can adequately do this. The incoming arcane damage in phase 1 can be heavily mitigated through prismatic elixir, tol barad trinket and anti-magic shell.\n\nPhase 2 is the most difficult part. The Nexus Lords don't hit terribly hard and are easily downed, however the Scion adds will kill you very quickly once you're on a disc and outside the protective shields. I was able to kill all 4 adds only by using every single available defensive cooldown I had and it took several attempts, the incoming damage is upwards of 30-40K/second without cooldowns as you get out from under the shield and the first two adds must be burned down quickly before you run out of cooldowns and are unable to outheal the incoming damage. You also cannot summon/sacrifice a ghoul while on a disc as pet summons do not work.\n\nIn phase 3 a self-sustain rotation (1 1 2 3) should probably be sufficient to survive all incoming damage with high enough ilevel from gear, and will build up 20 stacks reliably.

Not only that, but look at who appears to be spearheading all of the attacks?\r\n\r\nMalygos's \"fall\" seemed rather contrived. He was an ancient hero and I feel as though we didn't do him much justice in slaying him. If anything, he seemed rather convinced that he was doing Azeroth good, and we gave him little time to explain. His choppy lore can be tossed up with Illidan as \"righteous slaughter\" without so much merit, honestly. \"Madness\" was just pretty much tossed in with both characters.\r\n\r\nAlexstrasza was the key figure in attacking Malygos, and now the same with Deathwing. I mean, of course, Deathwing has had previous attacks on the dragonflight and his 'cataclysm' debut certainly isn't painting a very innocent picture. Additionally, even back in the BWL days the black dragonflight was all-around pretty gruesome.\r\n\r\nBut it's been a suspicion of mine now, for a long time, that Alexstrasza is a key figure in killing the other dragons. Think about it - she spearheaded the slaying of Malygos, and now she is opportunistically spearheading the assault against Deathwing. What happens next expansion?\r\n\r\nThe Emerald Dream is a likely next target. What can we do there? The most obvious choice is to rid it of 'corruption.' I'm noticing a trend - maybe Deathwing is actually evil - but Malygos seems to have just \"gone mad,\" while the emerald dream is just suffering from \"corruption,\" and the infinite dragonflight are led by no apparent leader other than the suspected Nozdormu.\r\n\r\nCould it be, perhaps, that Alexstrasza is pulling all the strings, here? Maybe she is, in fact, out to kill all of the other dragons, and manipulating the \"heroes\" into doing her bidding for her? Deathwing was dormant for a long time after his lack unsuccessful attempt on Alexstrasza's life, so maybe she just couldn't get to him sooner. Now that she can, she'll take her opportunity.\r\n\r\nWhat if she is the one organizing the corruption in the emerald dream, and will later tell players to slay Ysera under some bull!@#$ notion that Ysera is now 'corrupted' as well?\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, what if she is possibly manipulating the infinite dragonflight (Or, perhaps, influencing Nozdormu to lead it), only to later point the finger at Nozdormu and say HE was the one pulling the strings, telling us to slay him?\r\n\r\nAnd, after that - once we've slain 4/5 of the dragon aspects in over the next 2 expansions (leaving us at lv95) - she announces that her plans are complete, that she actually planned for us to kill the other 4 dragonflight aspects so she could be the sole ruler of all dragonkin? Of course, this is just a hunch, but after our acknowledging her betrayal, we might then launch an attack against her, killing her at lv100, marking the end of the WoW franchise as all 5 dragon aspects are defeated, finally opening the door for WoW2: 100(ish) years down the line, after the 5 dragon aspects are dead, where the world goes, how the Horde/Alliance might split up, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nEntirely speculation, but I wouldn't put it past Blizzard to think that far ahead and consider the various possibilities, especially judging by how shady the Malygos kill was.", "date": "2011-05-01T13:39:42-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Seeing as the dragon aspects have spent their power to defeat Deathwing and are now mortal your conspiracy theory does not work.", "creationdate": "2012-01-27T12:35:27-06:00", "id": 513010, "rating": 0, "commentid": 1406316, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "singularity", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

I reforged for 8% hit, had 39 expertise and 9 mastery (as little as possible) with haste/crit stacking. This boss is -barely- doable in this level of gear however, my equipped ilevel is 377. The only reason it is now doable is the death strike damage buff, which makes phase 1 go much more quickly.\n\nTo do this boss: Pull with army. AMS the breath as often as possible. Pop ghoul early (more or less useless damage as the sparks don't affect it). You'll have another ghoul to sac in P2. After the first vortex, kill the first spark before it reaches him, then grip the next spark on top of the aura from the first and kill it, same as you would have done when this boss was current content. Blow DPS cooldowns (DRW, engi gloves, on-use trinkets), burn boss, repeat.\n\nPhase 2 is the difficult part. Have a ghoul out to sac (you can not summon one while on a disc). Kill the first Nexus Lord, leave the second one alive on the ground. Fly up, AMS and burn one nether scion down, then drop down into a magic suppression zone and VB/DS heal up off the still alive Nexus Lord, killing it. Ghoul sac. Fly back up, IBF and kill the remaining scions as quickly as possible before you get overwhelmed by their damage (their arcane barrages still hit you for ~12K so having 3 of them up means you can't outheal them without IBF or AMS up). Don't ever army in P2 as this causes the Nexus Lords to scatter outside the suppression zones.\n\nPhase 3 is trivial at this item level of gear. Do a 1 1 2 3 rotation and start strafing just before a static field spawns so you don't take any damage from it, collect loot. I will note my drake was down below 100K HP a couple times even at this ilevel and if you lose your P3 stack, you're done.\n\nIt'd probably have been a bit less stressful if I dropped blood-caked blade or morbidity for rune tap and two points in WotN or blade barrier, but it only took me 3 attempts after the DS hotfix to kill.\n\nI did the fight in blood presence (the incoming P1 damage is out-healable), specced vamp blood but not rune tap,\nKill took 9:39.", "date": "2011-07-21T04:41:00-05:00", "rating": 10, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Been wanting to solo this guy on my DK for the mount.

If you're just in it for transmog gear though:[spoiler]Phase 1, full out DPS as he lands, try to get as much damage as you can before you need to heal. Save Shadowfiend or Dispersion to soak his breath attacks. If you have too much HP to proc Masochism on his melee attacks, you can let him eat a Power Spark to regain mana. Attempt to heal up during the spin cycle. Once your health drops low enough that you need to heal, de-form, and replace Mind Flay in your rotation with Flash Heal.\r\n\r\nAs you enter Phase 2, you may consider using Hymn of Hope for mana, as it will likely be tight on this phase. As soon as the Nexus Lords become attackable, unload on them. Get inside a bubble, and kill them off. While doing so, watch them for the magic buff, and mass dispel it ASAP. Once they're dead, hop on a disc and DPS the Scions down. Do [i]not[/i] fly into the air, instead, remain on the ground inside the bubbles, as this will reduce damage taken from the Scions significantly. When Malygos is about to deep breathe, then fly high enough that it will not tick on you, and return to the ground afterwards.\r\n\r\nOnce the Scions are down, heal up, mana up, and fall onto your new drake.\r\n\r\nDuring the initial monologue in Phase 3, stack up action 3 on yourself to 5 stacks. Once Malygos becomes attackable, begin the rotation: 1123. Be careful not to get close enough for him to melee you, get out of the lightning clouds, and if you cleared the previous phases fast enough, he'll go down without much difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf you're having trouble with berserk timer, and you're close to defeating him, try to fight from a high altitude in the final phase. After your drake dies, it will take longer for you to fall to your death, allowing the drake's DoT to tick a few extra times, and you to do some damage with instant casts.[/spoiler]", "date": "2011-12-13T23:29:01-06:00", "rating": 9, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 104, "id": 1639013, "nreplies": 4, "sticky": 0, "user": "aphistis", "body": "Straightforward solo encounter with my ilvl 396 hunter using turtle pet spec'ed for max survivability. Pushing through the first two phases is simple, with the drake phase giving me a little trouble at first because I wasn't playing WoW when Malygos was current content. I use my base 7/31/3 MM solo spec, glyphed for Arcane Shot/Steady Shot/Kill Shot, Misdirection/Mend Pet/Disengage, Feign Death/whatever/whatever. I don't use my T5 set for Malygos. His hard enrage is 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nPhase 1: \r\n- Fairly standard tank & spank. Misdirect, mend pet. etc.\r\n- Make sure you're flanking boss to avoid breath. \r\n- Spark buffs are helpful when I can get them, but I usually have several of them reach Malygos without any noticeable increase in pet healing burden.\r\n- Continue dps'ing boss during Vortex\r\n- NOTE: As others have noted, Vortex will despawn your pet leaving you vulnerable when Vortex ends. I resummon pet with 1 second of Vortex remaining, immediately disengage toward the edge to draw boss away from Yertle (pet). Letting boss take one melee swing at me, then feigning death to reset aggro, ensures enough time for pet health to rebuff.\r\n\r\nPhase 2:\r\n- Starts at 50% boss health. If you can get here within 3 minutes of starting the fight, you're in excellent shape.\r\n- Boss will drone on and on about some damned thing or other, ignore speech and continue dps'ing until he flies out of range and adds appear\r\n- Other people's comments regarding which adds are which might be helpful, but I honestly didn't pay much attention. If it had a red nameplate, it needed to die.\r\n- Boss creates purple buff zones on ground that reduce damage but shrink over time. This will create minimum range issues with ground adds. Attacking from inside a different bubble is ideal, but if necessary a reasonably geared hunter can survive outside the bubbles for long enough to kill a handful of adds at range.\r\n- Be careful not to let flying adds get behind you overhead. Keep 'em in front of you.\r\n- I've tried using discs and dps'ing from the ground. Easier and faster for me to just range adds down from the ground and soak the boss special attacks from inside a bubble. I've never had health issues doing that way, and chasing adds around on a disc is more trouble than it's worth.\r\n\r\nPhase 3:\r\n- NOTE: This phase takes at least three minutes and you can't reset the fight once it begins. If you don't win, you have to waste time wiping, running back, rebuffing, all that. If you won't make phase 3 with at least 3 minutes left to enrage, seriously consider resetting the encounter (deterrence -> dismiss pet -> feign death) to save yourself time in the long run.\r\n- Starts when phase 2 adds are all dead\r\n- Vehicle phase using drake mount\r\n- Read other people's comments for the rotation, but I pre-stack 5 hots and then do 1/1/2/3 ad infinitum same as others\r\n- You don't have to spam the abilities as fast as possible. I tried this at first and had big problems with the #2 dot stacks falling off before I could renew them. Just go a nice steady pace progressing through the rotation one button every second or two. You'll keep your hot stacks up, your dot stacks up, and your drake's energy up.\r\n- Ignore Surge of Power. Your hot stacks will heal through it.\r\n- Strafe clear of Static Field when boss casts. Your hot stacks will NOT heal through it.\r\n- Don't panic, at the start of this phase it looks like you'll never beat the enrage timer. Just keep adding your stacks and your damage will increase throughout the phase.\r\n- If you're having visibility issues, increasing your max camera distance and panning back can be helpful.\r\n\r\nCollect lootz, partake of lulz, brag to friendz.\r\n\r\nThis is my first wowhead comment, so I help it's helpful to someone!", "date": "2012-03-13T10:57:39-05:00", "rating": 126, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Still exactly how to do P3 at 90. worked great, ty!", "creationdate": "2012-10-26T23:17:08-05:00", "id": 591441, "rating": 21, "commentid": 1639013, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "kkronc", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "This worked awesome, thank you.

I'm affliction specced, using a voidwalker with grimoire of supremacy and soul link.\r\n\r\nThere's a bit of a bug with the boss, or it's not mentioned in the fight description.  There's an aggro reset after the vortex.  And as a warlock, it took a good while before my pet picked up aggro again (like 30 sec or so).  So you have a couple of options, either tank him yourself after the vortex, with the voidwalker whacking on him for about 30 sec till he re-establishes aggro, or you can soulshatter.  Soulshatter will return the aggro to your voidwalker, but it's on a 2 minute cooldown, so if you hit another vortex, you're going to face the exact same problem.  You will probably only face 2 vortexes, so your best bet is to shatter the first one, then just tank the 2nd one while using the proper defensive cooldowns and a healthstone.\r\n\r\nThis takes you into p2, because getting him to 50% was not difficult.  In p2, make sure you get your voids on the 4 melee guys, and dot them up.  It helps to kill the melee guys as quick as possible, because with all 4 of  them whacking on you, it can tax your health more than you would expect.  But if you just focus them down, it will be easy going until p3.  I use the glyph of corruption that gives you back some health whenever it ticks....so i would just dot up as many of the scions as possible and you'll get plenty of self healing from it.  the scions have less than 400k health, so you can easily focus them down one at a time or just dot them all as they circle around you in the air.  \r\n\r\nonce you get to p3, its just like everyone else in the thread says...quickly get yourself to 5 stacks of the hot (number 3), then once maly becomes targetable, just concentrate on doing 1-1-2-3, then repeat that sequence until he dies.  1-1-2-3 will do two things...it will keep your stack of hots on yourself, and it will slowly build a stack of dmg to maly.  On 25 man, it took a while for him to go down.  His health will not change much until you start getting your dps stacks around 20, then you will notice his percentage will start dropping.  If you find you make a mistake with your rotation and have to choose between dropping your hots or dropping your dps stack, keep the dps stack up or you probably won't survive.  It's much easier to regain your 5 stack of hots than a 20 stack of dmg.  \r\n\r\nI hate to be \"that guy\" but the mount dropped the first time, so I can't really tell you if blizz changed it to 100% chance now, or if I just got lucky.

I'll leave this writeup intact for those who want to try at lower levels, but anyone level 90+ will have Malygos nearly dead when phase 3 starts.[/i]\n\nSet your raid difficulty. The mounts are just as likely to drop in 10-man as in 25, so I'll assume that's what you're doing. At lvl 90 you shouldn't have much trouble with 10-man. Enter the instance by taking the top-most portal inside the spire at The Nexus in Coldarra, Borean Tundra.\n\nStart the fight by clicking the big orb in the middle of the platform. Beat Malygos down. Sparks will spawn; you can kill or ignore them. When Malygos becomes untargetable, phase 2 has started. \n\nAdds will spawn on hoverboards. Kill one and get on their hoverboard. Fly around killing the other adds. Stay well above the main platform, so you don't get hit by what Malygos is throwing out. When the last hoverboard add is killed, phase 3 starts.\n\nYou are plopped on the back of a red drake. You have three buttons of interest here:\n1 - direct damage\n2 - stacking damage over time\n3 - self heal over time\n\nStart pressing 3 immediately upon landing on your red drake. You should be able to get a full stack of five going before Malygos engages. Fly up a little so you can see him. Target him when he becomes targetable and start your casting rotation: 1, 1, 2, 3. At times you will have to wait for the next button in your rotation to become available (usually 2). Do not skip a button! Just wait patiently until you can continue in order. \n\nHover in place, working your rotation. When Malygos hits you with the extra bright, electric-sounding cloud, strafe sideways out of it. Do not let this interrupt your rotation, even if it takes you a few extra seconds to get moved. \n\nKeep working your rotation and scooting out of the electric clouds as needed. As the stacks of your damage over time accumulate on Malygos, his health will drop more quickly.\n\nOptional: Once you can do so without interrupting your rotation, back away until you're close to max range from Malygos. He has one spell that he'll only use if you're close, so staying back will reduce the damage you take. Just don't get out of range and lose those stacks of debuff! This isn't critical in 10-man but is something to try if you're struggling, or if you want to try 25-man.\n\nOnce the fight is over, Alexstrasza appears and creates a red diamond chest next to Malygos's blue heart. Open the chest, sigh in disappointment that it doesn't contain any mounts, and click the nearby portal to exit the instance.

With you at level 100, Malygos should already be near 1hp at this point, and a single attack or two from your drake -- mount/vehicle option 1 -- should finish him off.

From then on, Malygos would be known as The Spell-weaver, the guardian of magic and hidden arcanum.\r\n\r\nMalygos is a leviathan with small wings. His body is covered with crystalline scales of pure azure. His body shines with shifting colors that change constantly from blue to silver. Theoretically, since he and his children specialize in magic it is likely that their powers far exceed those of the other dragon flights since magic is the element they rule.\r\n\r\nMalygos the Spellweaver is the blue Dragon Aspect, and the master of the blue dragonflight. He is one of the most ancient creatures living on Azeroth, and one of only a handful who were alive at the time the Titans departed. Now that he has regained his sanity, he is once again taking an active role in the protection of the world.\r\n\r\nMalygos, the Lord of Magic, is said to have created magic and spells, although this is likely mere legend. His command of magic is quite impressive, rivaling that of a demigod, although he does not aspire to such power. While physically he is not as powerful as some of the other Aspects, Malygos counters this disadvantage with his phenomenal command of magic. Like most of his kind, Malygos is a solitary creature who avoids contact with others. He is believed to dwell in Northrend, in a lair filled with some of the greatest magical artifacts known to exist, including many whose powers are discussed only in hushed whispers. Returned to sanity after Deathwing\u2019s defeat at Grim Batol, Malygos now attempts to rebuild his decimated dragonflight. He spends his days studying magic, refining his abilities, and studying the various planes of the multiverse both remotely and in person, while his few remaining children scour the world for ancient artifacts and repositories of arcane power.\r\n\r\nMalygos does not seek out combat; and although he and his dragonflight are still routinely hunted by black dragons, he avoids their kind if at all possible. He protects his lair and himself with illusions and misdirection. Those who discover his home are encouraged to depart through a variety of means; Malygos takes direct action only as a last resort. When he does fight, he engages spellcasters first, using his breath weapon and other abilities to sweep spells from their minds.[/quote]\r\n\r\nHe's basically mad that the mortal races could use magic so freely, and is hostile to all users of magic.
