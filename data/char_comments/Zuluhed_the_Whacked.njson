Unlike his other Dragonmaw orcs he did not become a fel orc.\r\n\r\nZuluhed was apparently the last, and only shaman to accompany the Horde. He was eternally loyal to Blackhand during his reign as Warchief, and wished to remain so even after his death, so he pledged the allegiance of the small but powerful Dragonmaw Clan to Rend and Maim, the sons of Blackhand: an alliance assumed to be broken when Rend pledged the Black Tooth Grin clan to Nefarian's black dragonflight, most feared enemy of the Dragonmaw.\r\nDuring the Second War, Zuluhed received a vision of a powerful artifact hidden within the Redridge Mountains, and requested permission from Orgrim Doomhammer to locate it. Despite Zuluhed's apparent loyalty to the sons of Blackhand \u2014 his chief rivals \u2014 Doomhammer believed that the elder shaman acted in the Horde's best interests, and agreed to allow Zuluhed and his clan to find the artifact in question. Following the source of his visions, Zuluhed came into possession of what he called the Demon Soul. He assured Doomhammer that he would be able to unlock its powers, but this proved difficult even with the still-formidable powers of the elder shaman. Zuluhed decided to give the artifact to his Second, Nekros Skullcrusher, a former warlock, and with its power managed to capture the dragonqueen, Alexstrasza, and subjugate her red dragonflight. Alexstrasza, threatened with the death of her children, unwillingly gave the Horde an endless supply of her deadly progeny.\r\nAt some point Zuluhed returned through the Dark Portal to Draenor, and thus was not present when Alextrasza was freed and the majority of his clan destroyed at Grim Batol. He eventually pledged what remained of his clan to Illidan and enslaved Karynaku, matriarch of the Netherwing dragonflight, to provide drakes for his new master.\r\n\r\nSource www.wowpedia.org", "date": "2011-03-03T09:44:48-06:00", "rating": 18, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
