She's been fighting the Legion for millennia and predates even the Titans; Blizzard could've done so much more with this character but instead they wasted her on some \"Is the Light good or maybe not?\" story arc.  Besides, Illidan did worse to Akama (look up Shade of Akama on wowpedia).  Essentially, Illidan wasn't honoring his deal with Akama, locked him out of the loop and started acting more and more like an actual member of the Burning Legion, so Akama turned on him; in response Illidan enslaved a part of Akama's soul and threatened to have it devour him if he didn't do what Illidan said.  \r\n\r\nXe'ra's only mistake was not saying to Illidan \"I'm turning you into a form that Tyrande would want to bang\"; then he'd be all \"Let's do this!\"  (and also not telling the Army of the Light that Naaru could go Void).
