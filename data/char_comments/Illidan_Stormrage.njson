In his youth, he attempted to master the druidic forces, as his brother had, but the sorcery called to him in a way that the magic of the land did not. Unlike this brother, Illidan was born with golden eyes, at the time a sign of a great destiny - however, this actually indicated inherent druidic potential [1]. When Malfurion and Tyrande had found their destiny, Illidan was still searching for his. Though not a Highborne himself, he became the personal caster of the military leader Ravencrest.\r\n\r\nWhen Archimonde's invasion of Azeroth had begun and Azshara's treachery became known, Malfurion convinced Illidan to leave his queen. Illidan followed his brother. But as Cenarius and the Dragons entered the battle, Malfurion came to understand that their adversaries were too powerful to fall in combat. To end the invasion, he plotted the destruction of the Well of Eternity.\r\n\r\nThe idea appalled Illidan. The Well was the source of his magic - and likely of the elves' immortality - and its loss was a price far too dear for him to pay. In addition, the Night Elf found that he increasingly admired the powers of the Burning Legion, seeing a magical purity that underlay their chaotic behavior. Where the Night Elves struggled to maintain their ground, the Burning Legion seemed to grow ever stronger. [citation needed]. The Satyr Xavius seized upon his doubts, exploiting his confusion to plant seeds of distrust into Illidan's mind.\r\n\r\nIllidan had strong feelings for Tyrande Whisperwind, a novice priestess in the Sisters of Elune. Illidan so desired to impress Tyrande that he often acted without thinking, particularly in magic; he never realized that these displays weren't quite what the priestess was looking for in a mate. But while Illidan struggled to win her heart, none of them realized that the battle was over soon after it had begun; Tyrande had chosen Malfurion almost from the beginning. Xavius magically planted the suggestion in Illidan's mind that if Malfurion were to die, Illidan would no longer have a rival for Tyrande's love. Finally the sight of Tyrande in the arms of his brother Malfurion shattered his final link with the defenders\r\n\r\nIllidan, with a new plan spurred into his mind, journeyed to Zin-Azshari. There he feigned allegiance to Azshara and Mannoroth. Illidan's plan was to obtain the Demon Soul, an artifact of great power created by Deathwing, which had the ability to close the portal which was allowing the demons to enter Kalimdor. However to put this plan in action, Illidan had to gain more power.\r\n\r\nIllidan was eventually brought before Sargeras himself, who quickly doscovered the nigh elf's plan to obtain the Demon Soul for the Legion. Sargeras was pleased with this plan, and gave Illidan a \"gift\" in return for his allegiance. Illidan's eyes were gouged out, and orbs of mystic fire set in their place that allowed Illidan to see all forms of magic, and arcane tatoos covered his body. Azshara was fascinated by the \"new\" Illidan (who was wary of her advances), but remained cautious, sending Captain Varo'then to accompany Illidan, in his search for the Demon Soul.\r\n\r\nAfter the Great Sundering, Illidan scaled the peaks of Mount Hyjal, where he found a small, tranquil lake. There he poured the contents of three of the vials into the waters. The chaotic energies quickly manifested, tainting the lake and twisting it into a new Well of Eternity. Illidan's joy was short-lived however, when his brother, Tyrande, and the rest of the kaldorei leadership discovered him- and all were horrified at what he'd done.\r\n\r\nUnable to accept that his brother had committed such treachery, Malfurion tried again to explain to Illidan the folly of his ways. The magic, he insisted, was chaotic by nature, and it could only bring about destruction so long a", "date": "2007-06-03T23:26:49-05:00", "rating": 140, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Illidan refused to listen, so enraptured by the magic's power that his brother seemed to him an unknowing fool. His preservation of the Well, he thought, vindicated his treachery. He had saved the power. Future generations would know magic. Sorcery would not perish.\n\nThe lack of remorse shook Malfurion to his core and he raged at his brother, understanding now that Illidan was lost forever to the magic's sway. He ordered him imprisoned deep below Hyjal in a jail kept far from sight and mind.

His love for Tyrande undampened through the millennia of confinement, Illidan agreed to help. He swore to throw back the Legion and to depart from the night elves forever.\n\nMalfurion opposed Tyrande's decision, thinking the murder of the guards vile and the release of Illidan a catastrophic mistake. Frustrated that his brother remained unchanged and eager to prove to him that the demons had no hold over him, Illidan left Malfurion behind, leading a force of night elves into Felwood to hunt down the Legion. While in Felwood, he encountered Arthas, Champion of the Lich King, and they engaged in combat. The fighters were equally matched, and the combatants reached an impasse. Illidan stopped the duel and demanded to know why Arthas had tracked him. Arthas responded openly, telling Illidan about the Skull of Gul'dan, the demonic artifact that had corrupted Felwood. He explained that if the artifact were destroyed, the corruption of the forests would halt. To ensure that Illidan would take the bait, Arthas spared no detail of the Skull's power, adding that his master knew of Illidan's thirst for power.", "date": "2007-06-03T23:28:23-05:00", "rating": 131, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

When you start the fight remember this:\n\n4 Tanks must be used for his encounter: a Warrior in his normal gear, 2 offtanks in optimized fire protection gear and a warlock tank with shadow protection gear. 9 Healers are recommended, but the encounter can be completed with only 8. Frost specialized Mages are highly recommended both for their damage against fire-immune targets and the ultility of their defensive abilities. An over-abundance of melee DPS classes is not recommended, otherwise any DPS class setup is possible.\n\nIllidan got 5 stages:\n\n1 Stage\nHP: 6070400 Damage: 19914-28157\nAbilities:\nShear: Deals melee damage and reduces the target's maximum health by 60% for 7 sec.\nFlame Chrash: Deals 925 to 1075 Fire damage in an area in front of Illidan, as well as creating an area of fire in the same location. This area deals 5000 Fire damage to anyone who steps into it.\nDraw Soul: Deals 4500 to 5500 Shadow damage to everyone in front of Illidan, regardless of range. Illidan will gain 100,000 health for every target that is affected by this.\nParasitic Shadowfiend: Deals 3000 Shadow damage every 2 sec. for 10 sec. This also summons a Parasitic Shadowfiend at the end of the duration of the damage over time spell.\n\nWhen his health reaches 90%, Illidan calls fir the help of his minions which will be dealt with by Akama. The first stage continues until Illidan reaches the 65% mark, at which point he will fly in the air, starting stage 2.\n\nStage 2\nHP: 6070400 Damage: 19914-28157\nAbilities:\nFireball: Deals 2550 to 3450 Fire damage in a 10 yard radius.\nDark Barrage: Targets a random person in the raid and deals 3000 shadow damage per second for 10 sec.\nEye Blast: Deals a stream of damage across Illidan's chamber, incinerating targets with 19750 to 20250 Shadow damage in 6 yard radius around the blast. On top of this instant damage dealt, the eye blast also leaves behind a trail of fire that will damage players if they touch it.\n\nIn Stage 2 Illidan will fly in the air and cannot be attacked but he will throw down his 2 Blades of Azzinoth on opposite sides of the circle that marks the center of The Black Temple's  summit. Each blade will spawn a Flame of Azzinoth, a powerful fire elemental with over 1 million hit points. The second stage ends when both Flame of Azzinoth are dead. Move away from the inner circle and prepare for stage 3.\n\nStage 3:\nHP: 6070400 Damage: 19914-28157\nAbilities:\nAgonizing Flames: This is an area effect fire spell that deals damage over time to anyone affected. Deals a total of 36000 Fire damage over 60 sec. It hits a random player outside of 15 yards, unless it cannot find anyone, then it just hits anyone it can find. The damage it deals increases over time, similar to Curse of Agony.\nFlame Burst: Throws fireballs to everyone in the raid outside of 15 yards. Deals 3238 to 3762 Fire damage to the target and all targets in a 5 yard radius.\nSummon Shadow Demons: Summons 4 Shadow Demons to aid the caster. These demons cast Paralyze on a random target and move towards them slowly, ignoring everyone else. If they get to their target, they instantly kill them and choose a new target.\nUncaged Wrath: Increases Illidan's damage by 500%and movement speed by 200%\nDemonic Transformation: Turns Illidan into a massive demon with different abilities.\nShadow Blast: Deals area damage around the target and all friends of the target. This one will be fired off constantly during this phase, it has zero coldown.\n\nStage 4\n75 sec. after the death of the second Shard of Azzinoth which ended the second stage Illidan turns into his Demon Form and begin Stage 4.\nAt Stage 4 Illidan will wipe his threat meter.\n\nStage 5\nAs Illidan reaches 30% health, Maiev Shadowsong enters the battle. She periodically blinks to a player in the raid and places down a trap that can be use against Illidan. In this stage, Illidan enters an enraged state which significantly increases his damage. The tank needs to drag Illidan towards the trap, click to activate it, and position Illidan on top of it. While trapped, Illidan takes additional damage from every player attacking him. Keep attacking him until hes hit points reaches zero.

However this was found to not be true because both had bad outcomes. Later on these eyes were found out to be a sign of druidic potential. Like you said, Illidan was not a druidic person, yet addicted to arcane magic. In correction he was not called the Betrayer because of his defection to Sargeras because he came back to help. He was called the Betrayer when he created the second Well of Eternity. Before the explosion of the first Well, he filled vials with its waters. Upon the destruction of the first well, the Night Elfs found another lake in Hyjal. When they found this lake, they found that Illidan had poured the vials he had take from the first Well into this new lake. He thought that his people would praise him as a hero, however, his brother Malfurion was outraged. He was the decider of his fate because of how he helped rid Azeroth of Sargeras and because he was Illidan's borther. He felt that it would be cruel to sentence him to death but sentenced him to jail for the rest of his immortal life. (lol how does that work). In order to mask the second Well's existance from the Legion, they created what used to be the first world tree which also restored there lost immortality when the first Well was destroyed. 10,000 years later, the Burning Legion. This time the Legion was comanded by the Eradar Warlock Archimonde. On the way to the Barrow Dens to awaken the druids to aid them in the fight against the Legion, Tyrande Whisperwind noticed a jail which Illidan was kept in. She believed that Illidan was able to help them in the fight agains tthe Legion. Malfurion begged Tyrande not to set Illidan free but she defied him. Later, Illidan was confrounted by Arthas who gave Illidan the task of killing the Dread Lord Ticondrious. He then consumed the Skull of Gul'dan and killed Ticondrious. Consuming the Skull of Gul'dan, he awas transformed into a demon which gave him wings and horns and many other features. Malfurion found out that he has damned himself and exiled Illidan who lwas then hunted by Maiev Shadowsong. Maiev was the warden incharge of Illidan when he was in prison, when he escaped she vowed to hunt him down and kill him. After being exiled, Kil'jaeden gave him a task in echange for greater power. Kil'jaeden gave him the task of destroying the Lich King. He then went to Sageras' \"tomb\" to recover an artifact known as \"The Eye of Sargeras\". Illidan used the Eye to attempt to break apart Ice Crown which is where the Lich King is held. Malfurian and Maiev stoped him before he could destroy it. He then atempted to go to Ice Crown himself with his army of naga (the Highborn elfs that wer traped underwater for 10,000 years and turned into semi-amphybian creaturs) and the help of Kael'thas who pleged his loyalty to Illidan in search of magic for him and his Blood Elfs. He fought Arthas at Ice Cown but was mortally wounded but lived. Inorder to atempt to hide from Kil'jaeden's wrath, he fled to outland where he defeated the current lord of outland at the time, Magtheridon and became the new Lord of Outland. He is now the final boss in the 25-man raid instance of Black Temple.

Rather than becoming part of the \"lynch mob\" who want Illidan summarily executed, Malfurion speaks on his behalf, endorsing his knowledge of the Burning Legion as vital tactical information... giving an undeniable reason to bury Illidan rather than kill him. \r\n\r\nWhen we first were introduced to Malfurion and Illidan in Warcraft III, Malfurion objected fiercely to the idea of freeing Illidan, in the belief that his crimes were unforgivable and that he should stay locked up. When they were reunited Illidan was bitter about how he had been punished and Malfurion was disgusted to be in the same room as Illidan, still nursing a grudge over Illidan's betrayal. Illidan, who seemed to be the more forgiving one at the time, was eager to prove to his brother that the demons had no hold over him. Later, after Illidan used the powers of the Skull of Gul'dan for himself and took on a demonic appearance, Malfurion demanded to know where his brother was, implying he still had some affection for him. After Illidan revealed that he was the demon, Malfurion, rather than killing him simply banished him. Obviously, Malfurion knew Maiev Shadowsong would want Illidan imprisoned but still chose not to act. Rather than object, Illidan simply walked away. \r\n\r\nIllidan was next seen in Warcraft III: Frozen Throne. After the two worked together to save Tyrande, Illidan seemed to have forgiven Malfurion for disrupting his attempt to destroy the Frozen Throne, even though it would leave him at Kil'jaeden's mercy. Malfurion's last words to Illidan included an ominous threat about what would happen to him if he ever did anything against the Kaldorei again. This too, Illidan accepted without objection. Illidan admitted that he had known only \"ages of hate\" for his brother, but for his part he wished it to end. This is perhaps the closest thing to a peace that the brothers have achieved. Illidan then departed telling Malfurion he doubted they would ever see each other again. \r\n\r\nIn World of Warcraft, Malfurion's words indicate that he does not wish to fight his brother, and he says that if he is forced to, things will not be as they were at the Well at Zin-Azshari.", "date": "2008-07-02T17:27:10-05:00", "rating": 21, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

That brings joy and satisfaction to the players/customers, however it's kind of an abuse and at some point destroys the prestige this tragic figure of Warcraft had; I think we can all agree that Illidan is a fantastic character, both from appearance and beliefs. Among the peace, he is the screech; he was driven by desire, the lust for power, but he remained Illidan. He's not the kind of classic bad guy that gets insane or loses his mind. He does what he does conciously; he's the type of character seen in many movies, read in many books. Illidan, in literature terms, represents that so called \"weakness\", every human has well hidden beneath his flesh: desire. In that case, the desire to dominate his surroundings and ultimately, everyone and everything.\r\nHistory, however has a strange way of marking these people (in real life) with the big red label \"MADMAN\".

His second gift was the fire he was given in place of his eyes which allowed him to see magical energy flowing around him and in others. \n\nTurning several times during the war and saved only by his brother Malfurion, he acquired 12 Vials of Eternity. The vials were part of the Well of Eternity, which was a font of pure magic.

Then he figured out to destroy the Frozen Throne he'd need more allies, he called the Naga to the surface formerly the Quel'dorei servitors of Azshara, they were eager to take vengeance upon the Night Elves ( I seriously have no idea what this has to do with the Frozen Throne, that part was taken from wowwiki ), while he had the assist of the Naga he was being chased by Maiev Shadowsong ( http://www.wowwiki.com/Maiev_Shadowsong ) afterwards, he ran to the port of Nendis with his minions cleaning up after him, Illidan hijacked a boat and set sail, but the Naga stayed behind and destroyed everything so nobody would have a trace of finding him. Then the Naga swam in his trail, shortly after he came to the shores of the Broken Isles, the ruins of Suramar. But Illidan's servants had not been successful in destroying the boats. Maiev and the Watchers arrived on the Broken Isles shortly after Illidan, and the two forces battled across the watery terrain. Illidan reached the tomb, and Maiev was quick to follow. With Gul'dan's knowledge, Illidan quickly traversed the Tomb and came to the chamber which contained the Eye of Sargeras. Maiev came upon him as he and Vashj were activating the powerful artifact, and, as vengeance for her imprisoning him for ten thousand years, Illidan used the Eye to bring the Tomb down around her, and then quickly escaped through the underwater passages used by the naga. Though he killed Naisha and all the other Watchers within the Tomb, Maiev escaped with her magical abilities. On the surface, Illidan and Maiev battled for supremacy as the Warden sent out a runner to gather reinforcements from Ashenvale. Malfurion and Tyrande arrived on the Broken Isles with reinforcements as Maiev's base was being overrun. When they struck back, Illidan's forces crumbled, but he and his retainers fled before they were seriously harmed. Tyrande pursued them out of the base, and Illidan ensnared her to protect himself, and then warned her not to interfere. He fled across the sea once again. During this battle, Tyrande finally revealed why she had spurned Illidan: too drunk with his rising magical and political power, he had forgotten his own inner strength. Malfurion, despite his increases in power, held on to that strength within him. Armed with this knowledge, Illidan finally came to grips with his feelings. \r\n\r\nIllidan landed on the shore of Lordaeron, and quickly made his way through the Silverpine Forest to get to Dalaran, where Illidan began to use the Eye of Sargeras to break apart the polar ice cap and destroy Icecrown and the Frozen Throne. But he was interrupted by Maiev and Malfurion, and the spell failed. Malfurion had felt Illidan's spell tearing the land apart and concluded that he was a danger to the world and had to be stopped. Illidan, who was entangled by his brother, called Malfurion a fool as he was destroying the Lich King, their common enemy. Malfurion was furious at him for causing the loss of Tyrande, who had been, according to Maiev, killed. Illidan was heartbroken that the woman he loved was dead, but Prince Kael'thas, the night elves' newest ally, thought that perhaps it was premature to presume her dead. Kael'thas explained that Tyrande had not been \"torn apart\" by the undead, as Maiev had told Malfurion, but had instead fallen into a river and been swept away by the currents. Malfurion immediately arrested the Warden and promptly went in search of Tyrande. Illidan begged to be allowed to help his brother track down the beloved priestess. Illidan and his personal guard of naga found Tyrande under heavy attack from a massive undead force. \r\n\r\nIllidan and his naga battled their way through the undead until they reached her.

This ones for all the marbles and after its all over, you will have walked away with the privlage of saying \"I, [your name here] have SLAIN Illidan\" Your WoW forum trolling potental will be heightened considerably, your epeen will be legthened likewise, and may also experence some increased girth. Now that i have piqued your interest heres how you do it:\r\n\r\nFirst Impressions: Illidan is Tiny\r\n\r\nFor the Boss of the whole goddam game, Illidan is really freaking small, this is GAURANTEED to be your official first impression. Your secoond impression will be that illidan dosent care that you /dance or /train at him. Once Illidan starts his speech, you will have your third impression.....actually let me stop myself here, you are probally expecting me to make some wisecrack regarding your level of preparedness for this encounter, I wont engage in such petty tomfoolery, instead let me state for the record that your duplicity....is hardly suprising.\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Chillin with Illin\r\n\r\nThe Fight Will Start and You Will notice one thing quickly: He hits HARD. Use your phase 1 attempts to get the sheer joy of wiping to runaway parasitic infection out of your system. If you are melee DPS on this fight you will quickly observe that Illidan jumps really high, but fear not, as hitting the air where his body just was does the same amount of damage as hitting illidan himself. Once your Mages l2frost nova and your tank l2sheild block, its time for:\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Dinner is Served.\r\n\r\nChef Illidan has prepared a special meal for your raid: The Flames of azzinoth, and he encourages you to have a taste, but I would personally advise against it unless you are wearing full FR gear. Fans of bright colors will ejoy this phase: featuring Neon Green Fire, neon Blue Lazers, and Neon Blue Fire behind the Neon Blue lazers! As per WoW Raiding rule 47.2(b) You still Shouldnt stand in the fire. This phase is also where your warlock tank reveals he fergot to equip his Shadow Res Gear.\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Like Phase 1 But Different!\r\n\r\nPhase 3 Is an exciting and dynamic phase that is exactly the same as phase 1 except for something called agonozing flames. In order to not get agonizing flames you have to spread out. As a result your raid leader will spend phase three yelling on vent \"SPREAD OUT\" and \"HEY SPREAD THE !#!% OUT\" Eventually Illidan will get tired of his incessant whining and decide to start Phase 4:\r\n\r\nPhase 4: Our Warlock Tank is French Canadian\r\n\r\nPhase 4 is where Illidan gets Huge, everyone runs away from him, then you hope that you dont get demoned. You also have to spread out (when do you NOT have to spread out?). When other people get demoned you mess with their heads and pretend you arent going to kill it until it gets really close then you execute it, or at least thats what I do. If YOU get demoned you say something to the effect hey I got demoned, and then hope that you are well liked.\r\n\r\nPhase 5: ITS A TRAP!\r\n\r\nWhen Illidan reaches 30% Everyone Gets a sweet shadow bubble thing and then some guy with a hula hoop comes and talks crap to illidan. Then Hula Hoop guy runs someplace hilariously inconvienent such as directly against the back wall and drops a trap. Now in theory these traps are for illidan, they weaken him and make him take extra damage. In reality though the traps are actually traps for your raid that mess with your positioning and cause you to wipe to parasites. Most times you just ignore the trap and kill the mans, in which case its time for:\r\n\r\nPhase 6: The Afterglow\r\n\r\nCongratulations on your double vanquisher, healing cloak with spellhaste, felhunter on a stick and leather Bracer pattern. You are also gauranteed to get a warglave of azzinoth, unless someone in the raid diserves one.\r\n\r\nMore Important then loot however is that now you have killed illidan you are now offically \"Mr. Cool\" (See Attached Picture: http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/8091/1202253611206fk0.jpg )\r\n\r\nTry not to $%^& of too many \"casuals\" with your \"2 button epics\" and always remember that all your accomplishments mean nothing because they are MONTHS BEHIND.", "date": "2009-02-02T15:24:19-06:00", "rating": 49, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 1, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Parl - You might wanna note that Illidan isn't the boss of Burning Crusade, that's Kil'jaeden.

He developed an obsession to the magic of Azshara's close followers, but his brother Malfurion saw it as dangerous and convinced him to abandon it. But over time his hunger for magic became greater and greater.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Queen Azshara had been corrupted by the dark titan Sargeras. She had agreed to summon him into the world through the Well of Eternity - the elves' source of magical power. Some time after Illidan forsook magic, demons began pouring out of the Well of Eternity into the world. Illidan and Malfurion, aided by Tyrande Whisperwind and the demigod Cenarius, fought against the demons, but it was not enough. Malfurion saw only one option - to destroy the Well of Eternity - which was not only the demons' link to the world, but also the source of the elves' immortality and magic.\r\n\r\nHowever, Illidan's withdrawal from magic had taken it's toll on him. He left his companions and warned Azshara of Malfurion's plan. Malfurion and his allies soon attacked the Well, and in the midst of combat, Illidan procured an amount of the Well's water and disappeared. The Well was destroyed, and the earth was ripped apart.\r\n\r\nMalfurion and his allies sought to reach the holy Mount Hyjal, but Illidan beat them there. Using the water from the Well, he created a new Well of Eternity. But Malfurion hunted Illidan down, defeated him, and locked him in a barrow under the watch of Maeiv Shadowsong.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen thousand years later, during the Legion's invasion of Ashenvale, Illidan was released from his prison and procured the Skull of Gul'dan. Kil'jaeden approached him and offered enormous power to him in exchange for the destruction of the Lich King, Ner'zhul, whom Kil'jaeden created but was losing control of. Illidan sought out the powerful Eye of Sargeras, and, with the help of the naga, obtained it. He entered Dalaran and attempted to use it's vast magical energies to launch an attack on Icecrown Citadel from afar using the Eye. He was stopped at the last minute by Malfurion and Tyrande, who had come to help Maeiv, who had been hunting down Illidan. Illidan fled to Outland in order to escape Kil'jaeden's wrath. Maeiv followed Illidan, then captured him.\r\n\r\nAfter being cut off from the Sunwell, the blood elf race began to suffer. Their lord Kael'thas sought Illidan's aid in Outland. He defeated Maeiv and released Illidan. Illidan mustered his forces and decided to assault Icecrown once more. Seeing the assault, Ner'zhul called his loyal death knight Arthas to aid him. Arthas and Illidan's forces met at the stairs of Icecrown Citadel, and, in a climatic duel, Arthas defeated Illidan.\r\n\r\nAshamed, Illidan and his forces retreated to Outland, where they reside to this day. He reigns as a tyrant Lord over the remnants of Draenor and, with the help of Maeiv and Akama, Illidan's fake \"servant\", he must be killed.", "date": "2009-04-17T22:00:41-05:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Yeah, yeah, I realize that the original plan was to have a higher quality cutscene and show that Illidan, while defeated, did survive-whatever. \"The bottom of Icecrown was merely a setback!\")\r\n\r\nBut, look at the other Raid Bosses and Villains we've faced so far-\r\n\r\nNefarian-Tried to create a new brood of dragons and loose them on the world and *!@# ^&*! up the way his father did.\r\n\r\nC'Thun-Was trying to conquer the world with ugly bug things.\r\n\r\nKel'Thuzad (the first time)-Was just kind of a ^&*!@#bag. But really, leader of the Scourge outside of Northrend.\r\n\r\nKael'Thas-Went out of his $%^&ing gourd, got drunk on whatever moonjuice they were piping to him in the Netherstorm, then decided it would be a great idea to steal a Naaru, corrupt him, and then, say, I dunno, summon the leader of the most destructive organization in the universe in a kiddy pool at his summer home.\r\n\r\nI know I left out alot of major antagonists, but still, the point is, they all got what they deserved.\r\n\r\nBut what did Illidan do that was so bad? \r\nHe actually did a lot more good than harm.\r\n\r\nIn WCIII, he defeated Tichondrius, and severely hampered the Legion's offensive effort on the world tree by cutting their reinforcements. Without that edge, Archimonde would have set up a treehouse in Nordrassil and started taking a *!@# on Azeroth.\r\nOk, fine. In Frozen Throne, though, he did much, much more. First off, he jarred loose the scourge's foothold outside Northrend and effectively freeing The Forsaken. If you remember, he started casting this giant spell to shatter Icecrown, and was about halfway through it when Malfurion (&*!@#$bag) stopped him. He didn't destroy Icecrown or the Lich King, but the storyline indicates that it's this spell that causes Ner'Zhul's influence to wane enough to make Arthas come down with epilepsy or whatever, and wake Sylvanas up enough to cooperate with the dreadlords enough to stage the coup that sent Arthas back to Northrend, leaving the Scourge's future in Lordaeron in Kel'Thuzad's (cough) very capable hands. Of course, she turns on the dreadlords, screwing over the Legion...again...and freeing the Forsaken enough to establish themselves as a legitimate force and self reliant people.\r\nNow, while all that was happening, he was off in Outland, teaching the Blood Elves not to gnaw off their own hands in magic withdrawn frenzies, and went and kicked the ass of a Pit Lord who had enslaved the Broken in the Black Temple, screwing over the Legion...again. (Man, those guys just can't catch a good break.)\r\n\r\nSo why are we @#$%ed at him?\r\n\r\nBecause Kael'Thas attacked Shattrath? \r\nI mean, maybe Kael was just feeling crazy and cracked out from all the siphoned energy from the manaforges and thought, \"Hey, let's go knock over Shattrath.\" I mean, he's not known for great ideas. (See summoning Kil'Jaeden in kiddy pool reference.)\r\nNot his fault.\r\n\r\nBecause the Broken are being abused?\r\nUh, I didn't see any Broken being beaten up or getting all Rodney King'd on when I strolled through BT. From what I'm to understand, the Ashtounge held a place of honor in the Illidari. And it's not like Illidan enslaved them and made them get all ugly. The Orcs, under the influence of the legion, !@#$ed up the Temple of Karabor originally, and Magtheridon was just housesitting for Kil'Jaeden until he got his credit in order so that he could refinance the Black Temple or something. They actually had it pretty good with Illidan compared to all the other !@#$ they went through. Guess the grass is always greener on the other side of...the Temple...\r\n\r\nBecause he's mean to Maiev?\r\nHonestly, who gives a ^&*! In TFT, Malfurion has the crazy %^&*! arrested for lying about Tyrande's fate. Whisperwind would have been left for dead so that Maiev would get her shot at Illidan. Technically, she's an enemy of the Night Elf government, and just generally a psycho hose-beast.\r\n\r\nBecause he's a staunch enemy of the Burning Legion and the Scourge?\r\nYeah! Off with his head! How dare he fight those guys?\r\nOh, wait...\r\n\r\nI mean, I know alot of people will disagree with me because of what happened with the Sundering and whatnot, and that Illidan was a loose cannon and had to be eliminated.

In his youth, he attempted to master the druidic forces, as his brother had, but the sorcery called to him in a way that the magic of the land did not. Unlike his brother, Illidan was born with amber eyes, at the time a sign of a great destiny \u2014 however, this actually indicated inherent druidic potential.[1] When Malfurion and Tyrande had found their destiny, Illidan was still searching for his. Though not a Highborne himself, he became the personal caster of the military leader, Ravencrest.\r\n\r\nWhen Archimonde's invasion of Azeroth had begun and Azshara's treachery became known, Malfurion convinced Illidan to leave his queen. Illidan followed his brother. But as Cenarius and the dragons entered the battle, Malfurion came to understand that their adversaries were too powerful to fall in combat. To end the invasion, he plotted the destruction of the Well of Eternity. The idea appalled Illidan. The Well was the source of his magic \u2014 and likely of the elves' immortality \u2014 and its loss was a price far too dear for him to pay. In addition, the night elf found that he increasingly admired the powers of the Burning Legion, seeing a magical purity that underlay their chaotic behavior. Where the night elves struggled to maintain their ground, the Burning Legion's numbers did not seem to permanently diminish. The satyr Xavius seized upon his doubts, exploiting his confusion to plant seeds of distrust into Illidan's mind which made Illidan turn to seek the power the Burning Crusade were using so he could become stronger, while in his mind this was to help defeat the Burning Crusade he actually helped them by giving Sargeras the Demon Soul to make the portal stronger.\r\n\r\nIllidan had strong feelings for Tyrande Whisperwind, a novice priestess in the Sisters of Elune. Illidan so desired to impress Tyrande that he often acted without thinking, particularly in magic; he never realized that these displays weren't quite what the priestess was looking for in a mate. But while Illidan struggled to win her heart, none of them realized that the battle was over soon after it had begun; Tyrande had chosen Malfurion almost from the beginning. Xavius knew of this and used his power to darken Illidan's thoughts, convincing him that if Malfurion were to die, Illidan would no longer have a rival for Tyrande's love. Finally the sight of Tyrande in the arms of his brother Malfurion shattered his final ties to the defenders.\r\n\r\nIllidan, with a new plan spurred into his mind, journeyed to Zin-Azshari. There he feigned allegiance to Azshara and Mannoroth. Illidan's plan was to obtain the Demon Soul, an artifact of great power created by Deathwing also known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder, which had the ability to close the portal which was allowing the demons to enter Kalimdor. However, to put this plan in action, Illidan had to gain more power. Illidan was eventually brought before Sargeras himself, who quickly discovered the night elf's plan to obtain the Demon Soul for the Legion. Sargeras was pleased with this plan, and gave Illidan a \"gift\" in return for his allegiance. Illidan's eyes were burned out by Sargeras himself, despite still being beyond the portal, and orbs of mystic fire set in their place that allowed Illidan to see all forms of magic, and arcane tattoos covered his body. Azshara was fascinated by the \"new\" Illidan (who was wary of her advances), but remained cautious, sending Captain Varo'then to accompany Illidan in his search for the Demon Soul.\r\nIllidan from \"The Sundering\".\r\n\r\nAfter the Great Sundering, Illidan, who had filled seven vials with water from the Well of Eternity, scaled the peaks of Mount Hyjal, where he found a small, tranquil lake. There he poured the contents of three of the vials into the waters. The chaotic energies quickly manifested, tainting the lake and twisting it into a new Well of Eternity. Illidan's joy was short-lived however, when his brother, Malfurion, Tyrande and the rest of the kaldorei leadership discovered him - and all were horrified at what he'd done. Unable to accept that his brother had committed such treachery, Malfurion tried again to explain to Illidan the folly of his ways. The magic, he insisted, was chaotic by nature, and it could only bring about destruction so long as it existed.

You might think that had driven him mad, but he does succeed in saving his people (at the cost of becoming part demon). For this heroic act, he is exiled by his own brother, Furion. Then he is hired by the demon lord Kil'jaeden to destroy the Lich King before he regains his power and an expansion for World of Warcraft. Illidan is stopped by Furion, who was misled about the former's intentions. When Furion finds out that Maiev, Illidan's jailor, had betrayed him and lied about the death of his lover, Illidan and his brother work together to save said lover. \r\n\r\nAfterward, Illidan tries one last time to stop the Lich King, but is defeated at the end of Warcraft III's expansion. Thus Illidan had been, at worst, a Well-Intentioned Extremist who rarely did anything not in his people's interest (even the original reason for his imprisonment was for keeping part of the Well of Eternity, which he felt was too useful to completely destroy, even if it is what brought the demons).

To put salt in the wound, Maiev helps you defeat him, who was not only said to have died in multiple sources, but was the true traitor in Illidan's story, having left the night elven leader's lover for dead and allowing the Lich King to survive just for a chance to imprison somebody who was saving the world", "date": "2010-04-20T18:24:01-05:00", "rating": 70, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Kael'thas was about to betray him. His hope was to create a new Well of Eternity in Zangarmash. Sadly his project failed. He had a good stronghold in Hellfire Citadel and in Zangarmash, yes... But what about Shadowmoon and the Black Temple? There was just lot of chaos: burning legion and catastrophic earthquakes aswell as elementals were everywhere.\r\n\r\n**Now, as i see there are many problems about his origins and such, here's some informations from Wowwiki:\r\n[quote]Illidan (aka the Betrayer), twin brother of Malfurion, practiced Highborne magic. In his youth he attempted to master the druidic forces, as his brother had, but the sorcery called to him in a way that the magic of the land did not. Unlike his brother, Illidan was born with amber eyes, at the time a sign of a great destiny \u2014 however, this actually indicated inherent druidic potential.[1] When Malfurion and Tyrande had found their destiny, Illidan was still searching for his. Though not a Highborne himself, he became the personal caster of the military leader, Ravencrest.\r\nWhen Archimonde's invasion of Azeroth had begun and Azshara's treachery became known, Malfurion convinced Illidan to leave his queen. Illidan followed his brother. But as Cenarius and the dragons entered the battle, Malfurion came to understand that their adversaries were too powerful to fall in combat. To end the invasion, he plotted the destruction of the Well of Eternity. The idea appalled Illidan. The Well was the source of his magic \u2014 and likely of the elves' immortality \u2014 and its loss was a price far too dear for him to pay. In addition, the night elf found that he increasingly admired the powers of the Burning Legion, seeing a magical purity that underlay their chaotic behavior. Where the night elves struggled to maintain their ground, the Burning Legion's numbers did not seem to permanently diminish. The satyr Xavius seized upon his doubts, exploiting his confusion to plant seeds of distrust into Illidan's mind which made Illidan turn to seek the power the Burning Crusade were using so he could become stronger, while in his mind this was to help defeat the Burning Crusade he actually helped them by giving Sargeras the Demon Soul to make the portal stronger.\r\nIllidan had strong feelings for Tyrande Whisperwind, a novice priestess in the Sisters of Elune. Illidan so desired to impress Tyrande that he often acted without thinking, particularly in magic; he never realized that these displays weren't quite what the priestess was looking for in a mate. But while Illidan struggled to win her heart, none of them realized that the battle was over soon after it had begun; Tyrande had chosen Malfurion almost from the beginning. Xavius knew of this and used his power to darken Illidan's thoughts, convincing him that if Malfurion were to die, Illidan would no longer have a rival for Tyrande's love. Finally the sight of Tyrande in the arms of his brother Malfurion shattered his final ties to the defenders.\r\nIllidan, with a new plan spurred into his mind, journeyed to Zin-Azshari. There he feigned allegiance to Azshara and Mannoroth. Illidan's plan was to obtain the Demon Soul, an artifact of great power created by Deathwing also known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder, which had the ability to close the portal which was allowing the demons to enter Kalimdor. However, to put this plan in action, Illidan had to gain more power. Illidan was eventually brought before Sargeras himself, who quickly discovered the night elf's plan to obtain the Demon Soul for the Legion. Sargeras was pleased with this plan, and gave Illidan a \"gift\" in return for his allegiance. Illidan's eyes were burned out by Sargeras himself, despite still being beyond the portal, and orbs of mystic fire set in their place that allowed Illidan to see all forms of magic, and arcane tattoos covered his body. Azshara was fascinated by the \"new\" Illidan (who was wary of her advances), but remained cautious, sending Captain Varo'then to accompany Illidan in his search for the Demon Soul.\r\nfter the Great Sundering, Illidan, who had filled seven vials with water from the Well of Eternity, scaled the peaks of Mount Hyjal, where he found a small, tranquil lake. There he poured the contents of three of the vials into the waters. The chaotic energies quickly manifested, tainting the lake and twisting it into a new Well of Eternity. Illidan's joy was short-lived however, when his brother, Malfurion, Tyrande and the rest of the kaldorei leadership discovered him - and all were horrified at what he'd done. Unable to accept that his brother had committed such treachery, Malfurion tried again to explain to Illidan the folly of his ways. The magic, he insisted, was chaotic by nature, and it could only bring about destruction so long as it existed. Illidan refused to listen, so enraptured by the magic's power that his brother seemed to him an unknowing fool. Illidan claimed that magic would be needed should the Burning Legion ever return.\r\nThe lack of remorse shook Malfurion to his core and he raged at his brother, understanding now that Illidan was lost forever to the magic's sway. He ordered him imprisoned deep below Hyjal in a jail kept far from sight and mind.[/quote]\r\n\r\nWe all know he later escaped thanks to Tyrande Whisperwind who opened the cell after 10'000years, killing different wardens. (Also Maiev and his hatred, from antagonist, becomes one of the main ally in the Black Temple.)\r\n\r\n[quote]Malfurion opposed Tyrande's decision, thinking the release of Illidan a catastrophic mistake.

He told him to seek out the Frozen Throne, and destroy it. Ner'zhul had grown far too powerful for Kil'jaeden to control, and Illidan was to remove him from the equation; in exchange for more power and magic than he could dream of. He granted him the Orb of Kil'jaeden to aid him in this task.\nBy harnessing Gul'dan's enchanted skull, Illidan came to possess the warlock's memories, and a plan came to mind, but he would need allies to help him. He decided to enlist the aid of old friends.\nIllidan called the naga to the surface. The naga were eager to take vengeance upon the night elves and the other land walking races that had been spared from The Great Sundering. Azshara sent her handmaiden, Lady Vashj, to establish contact, the naga respecting Illidan's magical talent accepted the alliance and Vashj eventually came to lead those who would be known as \"Illidan's Naga\". But Illidan still had the troublesome warden, Maiev Shadowsong, to deal with, as she had persistently chased him all over Kalimdor. Illidan then allied with a group of satyrs. Then he ran to the port of Nendis with his naga and satyr minions protecting the way up behind him. Maiev killed the furbolgs and defeated his forces, but when she came to the port, Illidan hijacked a boat and set sail, while a cadre of naga stayed behind to scuttle the ships and ruin all hopes of following him.\nWith the naga swimming in his wake, Illidan came ashore on the Broken Isles \u2014 the ruined remains of Suramar (ironically, the same city where Illidan grew up) which Gul'dan and his warlocks had raised twenty years before, and the home of the Tomb of Sargeras. Malfurion and Tyrande arrived on the Broken Isles with reinforcements as Maiev's base was being overrun. When they struck back, Illidan's forces crumbled, but he and his retainers fled before they were seriously harmed. Tyrande pursued them out of the base, and Illidan ensnared her to protect himself, and then warned her not to interfere. He fled across the sea once again. During this battle, Tyrande finally revealed why she had spurned Illidan: too drunk with his rising magical and political power, he had forgotten his own inner strength. Malfurion, despite his increases in power, held on to that strength within him. Armed with this knowledge, Illidan finally came to grips with his feelings.\nIllidan landed on the shore of Lordaeron, and quickly made his way through the Silverpine Forest to get to Dalaran, where Illidan began to use the Eye of Sargeras to break apart the polar ice cap and destroy Icecrown and the Frozen Throne. But he was interrupted by Maiev and Malfurion, and the spell failed. Malfurion was furious at him for causing the loss of Tyrande, who had been, according to Maiev, killed. Illidan was heartbroken that the woman he loved was dead, but Prince Kael'thas, the night elves' newest ally, thought that perhaps it was premature to presume her dead. Kael'thas explained that Tyrande had not been \"torn apart\" by the undead, as Maiev had told Malfurion, but had instead fallen into a river and been swept away by the currents. Malfurion immediately arrested the Warden and promptly went in search of Tyrande. Illidan begged to be allowed to help his brother track down the beloved priestess. Illidan and his personal guard of naga found Tyrande under heavy attack from a massive undead force.\nIllidan and his naga battled their way through the undead until they reached her. Tyrande was taken aback by Illidan's service to her, and when he delivered her safely to Malfurion, she was astonished. Malfurion told Illidan he was free to go on the condition that he never threaten the night elves again. Illidan, wishing for an end to the conflict with his brother, agreed.\nAfter Malfurion let him go, Illidan created a portal to Outland and fled immediately, pursued by Maiev. Now that he had failed to destroy Ner'zhul, he knew that Kil'jaeden's wrath would not spare him, so he wanted to find a world where he could remain unmolested. He felt that Outland, the ruined remains of Draenor, was just such a place.\nIllidan was chased down on the shattered world until he was captured by Maiev and the Watchers, and imprisoned once again. But he was saved by Kael and Vashj. Illidan accepted the allegiance of the blood elves, and made Kael his second-in-command. The Sin'dorei, coupled with the naga, would be very invaluable to his plans. Illidan continued his original plan - to rid Outland of demonic influence so that he could stay out of Kil'jaeden's grasp. To do this, they laid siege to the Black Temple of Magtheridon, the Pit Lord who had taken control of the world. But first, Illidan systematically shut down his dimensional gates to stem the flow of reinforcements. Eventually, they succeeded.\nWhen they came to the Black Temple, Illidan was approached by Akama of the Broken, who pledged the allegiance of his race. Akama's broken felt indebted to Illidan and his army for aiding them in their fight against the fel orcs of Magtheridon, who had laid siege to their village with the intent of slaughtering them all. They laid siege to the Black Temple and destroyed Magtheridon's defenses, and then defeated the Pit Lord in battle himself. Magtheridon noted wryly that Illidan had great power, and asked if the Legion had sent him as a test. Illidan laughed, saying that he was not a test, but a replacement, and imprisoned Magtheridon beneath Hellfire Citadel and kept sealed in place by the fel orc jailor Keli'dan the Breaker.\nAs Illidan rallied the forces of Outland under a new banner, a storm of fire and smoke descended upon the Black Temple, and Kil'jaeden appeared in all his unholy glory. Chastising Illidan for his foolhardy attempts to flee his wrath, Illidan quickly claimed that he had been gathering his forces for a second attack on the Frozen Throne. Kil'jaeden, seeing that Illidan's new comrades \"showed some promise\", agreed to give Illidan one more chance to appease the demons.\nIllidan, Vashj, and Kael laid siege to Northrend and battled Anub'arak's forces as they trudged through the snow towards the Icecrown glacier. But Ner'zhul, knowing he would be overrun if he didn't do something, called Arthas to Northrend to complete the plan he had set in motion so many months before. Finally, Illidan's forces arrived at Icecrown as Arthas and Anub'arak dug their way out of Azjol-Nerub, and the two factions squared off in a titanic battle as they tried to gain control of the four mystical obelisks surrounding the glacier. After a long battle, and control going back and forth between the two enemies, Arthas activated all obelisks, and the doors to the Frozen Throne were opened.\nBut Illidan was not finished yet. Meeting the weakened Arthas at the glacier's base, the two warriors engaged in single combat. After a few minutes of exchanging blows, however, Arthas overcame Illidan's defenses and cut him down. Illidan Stormrage fell in the snow, dead, or so it seemed. He was badly wounded, but not killed. Arthas was quite aware of this, and before taking his leave, warned Illidan to leave Azeroth and never return. After it became clear for Vashj and Kael that they could not destroy the Frozen Throne, they retreated, taking Illidan with them[/quote]", "date": "2010-09-30T12:23:38-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-09-30T12:25:48-05:00", 1, "MalygosHelper"]}

Seeking to bring down her erstwhile prisoner, Maiev allied with Akama to invade the Black Temple, where she cornered Illidan in his inner sanctum and struck him down, bringing an end to one of the most tragic stories in Azeroth's history. \r\n\r\nFor more lore information about Illidan Stormrage: http://www.wowwiki.com/Illidan_Stormrage (wowwiki)\r\n\r\nEdit: He's my favorit boss in wow 4ever! \"You are not prepared!\"", "date": "2010-10-16T10:20:12-05:00", "rating": 14, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

All his life he had been told that he was destined for greatness, for legend, and here he had thought that his time had come. His people were in panic, with nothing standing between them and genocide. Surely [i]now[/i] was the moment when he became a part of epic history.\r\nAnd perhaps he would have, if not for two of those he trusted most. Lord Ravencrest had taken him under his wing, raising Illidan up from nothing to a sorcerer of noble rank in the blink of an eye. His master had given him control of the remaining Moon Guard, and the twin believed that he had done well in the role of lead spellcaster.\r\nNow, though, Ravencrest had removed him, replaced Illidan with one who was not even a night elf. For all the respect that Illidan had for Rhonin, this was too much. The wizard should have seen that, too; had Rhonin had any true confidence in him, the outsider would have refused the role.\r\nHis moment of greatness had been stolen from him... and in its place he was now reduced to calling for his so-admired brother.\r\nThe dark thoughts that had of late invaded his mind returned in full force. Although he worked to open the link that Rhonin had requested, Illidan half-hoped to discover that the reason Malfurion was still missing was that he had fallen victim to the Burning Legion. Illidan expected his twin to go down fighting heroically, of course, but beyond that he found that he was not at all that shaken by the image of a dead Malfurion. Tyrande would be upset, obviously, but the sorcerer would comfort her...\r\nThinking of Tyrande scattered away much of the darkness. Illidan felt regret for any pain that the actions he imagined would cause her. How could he [i]think[/i] of putting her through that, even for him? She had chosen Malfurion, and that was that.\r\nForcing himself to focus on his twin, Illidan concentrated. First he would deal with this situation, then make a decision about his future. He had thought it lay with Ravencrest and Tyrande, and in both manners he had been wrong.\r\nNow Illidan had to decide just [i]where[/i] he belonged...\"\r\n\r\n- Taken from \"The Demon Soul\" from the \"War of the Ancients\" trilogy, by Richard A.

Magic is Illidan speciality, Arthas is good in using blades, expecially a legendary sword, Frostmourne.\r\n2) Arthas was at his full power, the Lich King restored him his powers. And he was wielding a legendary weapon, thing that Illidan doesn't had. If you're talking about Lich King and not Arthas (as Arthas died that day), then it's completely different: The Lich King has just the body of Arthas, but the spirit of Ner'zhul.\r\n3) Arthas, as one being, is less powerful than Illidan. On the other hand, Arthas is a better warrior.\r\n\r\nIn the cinematic, aswell as in the quest, it's said that Arthas was near his death, after the duel... You can imagine the consequences.\r\nAlso, i'm wondering that, as, since the end of the campaign, Illidan declared war against the Burning Legion, the Scourge and the Illidari, in an other reality, could have been allied.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 7, "id": 68555, "nreplies": 6, "sticky": 0, "user": "41526", "body": "Illidan is the twin brother of Malfurion Stormrage, the first Night Elf druid. Illidan and Malfurion competed for the love of Tyrande Whisperwind, a Night Elf priestess and the current boss of Darnassus. When Archimonde's Burning Legion first invaded Azeroth, Malfurion and Illidan worked to stop him, but Illidan's jealousy over Tyrande eventually led him to betray his brother. Malfurion planned to destroy the Well of Eternity, the fount of arcane magic on Azeroth. Illidan spirited away a couple vials of the well's water before its destruction so he could still have some power after the Burning Legion took over. Illidan used the vials to create a new Well of Eternity, but was caught by his brother and sentenced to be forever imprisoned beneath the earth.\n\nTen thousand years after Illidan was imprisoned, Tyrande freed him so he could help fight the Scourge. Malfurion and Illidan's keeper, Maiev Shadowsong, opposed this decision and vowed to track down Illidan. Meanwhile, Illidan led some night elves to Felwood and briefly fought Arthas, then the champion of the Lich King. Arthas told him that destroying an artifact called the Skull of Gul'Dan would seriously weaken the Burning Legion. When Illidan found the Skull, he consumed it instead of destroying it, turning himself into a demon hybrid. Illidan thought this would help defeat the Burning Legion and make him look better to Tyrande and Malfurion, but instead they banished him after he defeated the forces of Tichondrius.\n\nIllidan was then visited by Kil'Jaeden, the commander of the Burning Legion. Kil'Jaeden commanded him to destroy the Lich King, Ner'Zhul, since Ner'Zhul had grown too powerful for the Legion to control. Illidan gathered an army of Naga and set forth to find the powerful Eye of Sargeras (killing a large number of his former captors in the process.) He took the Eye to Lordaeron and tried to melt the ice of the polar ice cap and destroy Ner'Zhul's land. Yay for global warming as a plot device! But Malfurion and Maiev stopped him, believing his plan would destroy the whole world.\n\nAfter Illidan saved Tyrande from a horde of undead, Malfurion allowed him to escape to Outland to get away from Kil'Jaeden's wrath. Maiev followed and recaptured him, but the blood elf Kael'Thas and the naga Lady Vashj freed him. Together, Illidan, Vashj and Kael'Thas conquered Outland. Things were looking good for Illidan -- he had some loyal lieutenants, a new palace, and a whole world to himself. Unfortunately, Outland was metaphorically in Kil'Jaeden's backyard, and the demon soon tracked down Illidan and made him once again promise to destroy the Lich King.\n\nIllidan and his forces returned to Azeroth and fought up to the Lich King's throne. But Ner'Zhul had called his champion, Arthas, to the throne to receive his powers. Arthas and Illidan met in battle once more, and Arthas defeated Illidan and left him for dead. Arthas ascended the Frozen Throne to become the new Lich King, and Illidan was dragged back to Outland in disgrace.\n\nWhere he is now: Illidan reigns over Outland from the Black Temple, along with his lieutenants Kael'Thas and Lady Vashj. He controls his own faction, the Illidari, but it is unknown whether he is serving the Burning Legion or his own interests.\n\nIdentifying characteristics: According to the official World of Warcraft site, Illidan has retained most of his night elf characteristics despite becoming part-demon, and is therefore pretty unpredictable. Illidan has had his eyes gouged out -- he now has magical vision bestowed by the Burning Legion -- and he has bat-like wings and horns in his demon form.\n\nWhy we have to kill him: If Illidan's serving the Burning Legion, he's helping them plan the destruction of Azeroth. If he's not serving the Burning Legion, then we're basically invading his country for revenge, which makes us kind of jerks. Most likely, Illidan has some sort of plot against Azeroth that requires us to step in and Save The World Again.", "date": "2007-04-17T09:22:50-05:00", "rating": 78, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "To clarify, Illidan is not serving the Legion anymore.

Then he figured out to destroy the Frozen Throne he'd need more allies, he called the Naga to the surface formerly the Quel'dorei servitors of Azshara, they were eager to take vengeance upon the Night Elves ( I seriously have no idea what this has to do with the Frozen Throne, that part was taken from wowwiki ), while he had the assist of the Naga he was being chased by Maiev Shadowsong ( http://www.wowwiki.com/Maiev_Shadowsong ) afterwards, he ran to the port of Nendis with his minions cleaning up after him, Illidan hijacked a boat and set sail, but the Naga stayed behind and destroyed everything so nobody would have a trace of finding him. Then the Naga swam in his trail, shortly after he came to the shores of the Broken Isles, the ruins of Suramar. But Illidan's servants had not been successful in destroying the boats. Maiev and the Watchers arrived on the Broken Isles shortly after Illidan, and the two forces battled across the watery terrain. Illidan reached the tomb, and Maiev was quick to follow. With Gul'dan's knowledge, Illidan quickly traversed the Tomb and came to the chamber which contained the Eye of Sargeras. Maiev came upon him as he and Vashj were activating the powerful artifact, and, as vengeance for her imprisoning him for ten thousand years, Illidan used the Eye to bring the Tomb down around her, and then quickly escaped through the underwater passages used by the naga. Though he killed Naisha and all the other Watchers within the Tomb, Maiev escaped with her magical abilities. On the surface, Illidan and Maiev battled for supremacy as the Warden sent out a runner to gather reinforcements from Ashenvale. Malfurion and Tyrande arrived on the Broken Isles with reinforcements as Maiev's base was being overrun. When they struck back, Illidan's forces crumbled, but he and his retainers fled before they were seriously harmed. Tyrande pursued them out of the base, and Illidan ensnared her to protect himself, and then warned her not to interfere. He fled across the sea once again. During this battle, Tyrande finally revealed why she had spurned Illidan: too drunk with his rising magical and political power, he had forgotten his own inner strength. Malfurion, despite his increases in power, held on to that strength within him. Armed with this knowledge, Illidan finally came to grips with his feelings. \r\n\r\nIllidan landed on the shore of Lordaeron, and quickly made his way through the Silverpine Forest to get to Dalaran, where Illidan began to use the Eye of Sargeras to break apart the polar ice cap and destroy Icecrown and the Frozen Throne. But he was interrupted by Maiev and Malfurion, and the spell failed. Malfurion had felt Illidan's spell tearing the land apart and concluded that he was a danger to the world and had to be stopped. Illidan, who was entangled by his brother, called Malfurion a fool as he was destroying the Lich King, their common enemy. Malfurion was furious at him for causing the loss of Tyrande, who had been, according to Maiev, killed. Illidan was heartbroken that the woman he loved was dead, but Prince Kael'thas, the night elves' newest ally, thought that perhaps it was premature to presume her dead. Kael'thas explained that Tyrande had not been \"torn apart\" by the undead, as Maiev had told Malfurion, but had instead fallen into a river and been swept away by the currents. Malfurion immediately arrested the Warden and promptly went in search of Tyrande. Illidan begged to be allowed to help his brother track down the beloved priestess. Illidan and his personal guard of naga found Tyrande under heavy attack from a massive undead force. \r\n\r\nIllidan and his naga battled their way through the undead until they reached her.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 24, "id": 520804, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "262942", "body": "Illidan is the twin brother of Malfurion Stormrage, the first Night Elf druid. Illidan and Malfurion competed for the love of Tyrande Whisperwind, a Night Elf priestess and the current boss of Darnassus. When Archimonde's Burning Legion first invaded Azeroth, Malfurion and Illidan worked to stop him, but Illidan's jealousy over Tyrande eventually led him to betray his brother. Malfurion planned to destroy the Well of Eternity, the fount of arcane magic on Azeroth. Illidan spirited away a couple vials of the well's water before its destruction so he could still have some power after the Burning Legion took over. Illidan used the vials to create a new Well of Eternity, but was caught by his brother and sentenced to be forever imprisoned beneath the earth.\r\n\r\nTen thousand years after Illidan was imprisoned, Tyrande freed him so he could help fight the Scourge. Malfurion and Illidan's keeper, Maiev Shadowsong, opposed this decision and vowed to track down Illidan. Meanwhile, Illidan led some night elves to Felwood and briefly fought Arthas, then the champion of the Lich King. Arthas told him that destroying an artifact called the Skull of Gul'Dan would seriously weaken the Burning Legion. When Illidan found the Skull, he consumed it instead of destroying it, turning himself into a demon hybrid. Illidan thought this would help defeat the Burning Legion and make him look better to Tyrande and Malfurion, but instead they banished him after he defeated the forces of Tichondrius.\r\n\r\nIllidan was then visited by Kil'Jaeden, the commander of the Burning Legion. Kil'Jaeden commanded him to destroy the Lich King, Ner'Zhul, since Ner'Zhul had grown too powerful for the Legion to control. Illidan gathered an army of Naga and set forth to find the powerful Eye of Sargeras (killing a large number of his former captors in the process.) He took the Eye to Lordaeron and tried to melt the ice of the polar ice cap and destroy Ner'Zhul's land. Yay for global warming as a plot device! But Malfurion and Maiev stopped him, believing his plan would destroy the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter Illidan saved Tyrande from a horde of undead, Malfurion allowed him to escape to Outland to get away from Kil'Jaeden's wrath. Maiev followed and recaptured him, but the blood elf Kael'Thas and the naga Lady Vashj freed him. Together, Illidan, Vashj and Kael'Thas conquered Outland. Things were looking good for Illidan -- he had some loyal lieutenants, a new palace, and a whole world to himself. Unfortunately, Outland was metaphorically in Kil'Jaeden's backyard, and the demon soon tracked down Illidan and made him once again promise to destroy the Lich King.\r\n\r\nIllidan and his forces returned to Azeroth and fought up to the Lich King's throne. But Ner'Zhul had called his champion, Arthas, to the throne to receive his powers. Arthas and Illidan met in battle once more, and Arthas defeated Illidan and left him for dead. Arthas ascended the Frozen Throne to become the new Lich King, and Illidan was dragged back to Outland in disgrace.\r\n\r\nWhere he is now: Illidan reigns over Outland from the Black Temple, along with his lieutenants Kael'Thas and Lady Vashj. He controls his own faction, the Illidari, but it is unknown whether he is serving the Burning Legion or his own interests.\r\n\r\nIdentifying characteristics: According to the official World of Warcraft site, Illidan has retained most of his night elf characteristics despite becoming part-demon, and is therefore pretty unpredictable. Illidan has had his eyes gouged out -- he now has magical vision bestowed by the Burning Legion -- and he has bat-like wings and horns in his demon form.\r\n\r\nWhy we have to kill him: If Illidan's serving the Burning Legion, he's helping them plan the destruction of Azeroth. If he's not serving the Burning Legion, then we're basically invading his country for revenge, which makes us kind of jerks. Most likely, Illidan has some sort of plot against Azeroth that requires us to step in and Save The World Again.", "date": "2008-12-20T06:13:37-06:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
