Pay your respects to [s]the Warchief[/s] [i]Vol'jin and Baine[/i]. Oh, what? Just because he's Human, you thought Wrynn was the \"good guy\"? Hence the half-right part. The good guys are about that. But your ruler isn't one of them. All the more proof of just how racist you Allies really are.

Go figure.\n\nedit: I was looking at posts I'd made and found this one. I'd like to point out that despite -1 total, the votes are pretty well split of +8,-9. I don't know when the votes happened, but this was entirely true when posted it, which was pre-Garrosh Warchief. I've since edited to account for Garrosh's horrid treatment and segregation of the other races. I would also assume the negative votes were from Ally-only players who didn't like the truth. Racism plays a big part in this game. Look at the Durnholde 5-man in Caverns of Time. Look at the history of the worlds in-game. Most people hate gnomes, Elves (both sides) think they're above everyone else, Humans hate any of the animalistic looking races and really only get along with Dwarves if anything. Everyone pretty much fears/is disgusted by the Forsaken/Undead, the Forsaken hate anything \"alive\", and humans hated the Worgen until they themselves became them. And even then you have people killing themselves before becoming turned into one.

The attack by Putress on the forces at Angrathar was not orchestrated by the Horde or its leadership. Like Zaelan said, there's absolutely no proof of that. The simple fact of the matter is that Putress acted on his own, with his own group of renegade Forsaken that defied Sylvanas and the rest of the Horde. That's the conclusion I've reached given the evidence that we [i]do[/i] have at our disposal right now.\r\n\r\nBut let's assume Sylvanas [b]did[/b] plot the whole event at Angrathar. First of all, look at the victims of Putress' attack. The victims included a substantial number of Horde soldiers, most of whom were from the elite Kor'kron forces that serve as the personal guard of Thrall himself. And then there's Saurfang the Younger, son of High Overlord Saurfang and the most prolific victim on the Horde side. If the Horde discovers that Sylvanas is indeed the mastermind behind their deaths, then she stands a great risk to not only destroy the partnership between her Forsaken and the Horde, but to incur the personal wrath of the Warchief. She would not stand a chance in the subsequent battle.\r\n\r\nSecondly, what would she stand to gain by giving Varimathras [i]carte blanche[/i] to allow demons to run rampant through her main base of operations? Back in the Third War, she and her Forsaken fought hard to gain control of the city of Lordaeron. Thus to relinquish control of it to the Burning Legion doesn't make sense considering the bulk of her resources are at the Undercity. And yes, the Forsaken have bases in Northrend and Tarren Mill, but let's be honest here; without their foothold in Lordaeron, they will lose a lot more territory than they can afford to in the long run.\r\n\r\nBigalmou, while your view on what happened may very well be the one that Varian Wrynn himself sees, it just doesn't amount to anything more than a wild conspiracy theory cooked up by an Alliance partisan. But in the spirit of fairness, I'd like to add one last point; Sylvanas, from what we know about her, is a reclusive but brilliant strategist. Her primary goal is to get revenge on Arthas, but once that's achieved, who knows where she'll go from there? If she is indeed behind the massacre at Angrathar, then she's hiding her involvement in it (and her motives for it) very, [i]very[/i] well. But for now?

Oh wait ... he was RAISED as a gladiator, having no real childhood whatsoever... and the only thing he knew of his people was this old broken down old orc that he didn't even know jumping from his shakles and attacking his guards dying only to try to give freedom to the future Warchief.

Hint hint dumbass hint hint. \r\n\r\n\r\n[i]4. The Orcs destroyed Stormwind, and forced Wrynn to retreat to lordaeron where he grew up. Lordaeron was like a second home to him, and even though he knew Arthas destroyed it, he hadn't seen it in person until he led the Attack there that killed Putress. Seeing Lordaeron transformed into the Undercity was shocking, and offensive, and from a Lore-wise perspective, it was the first time anyone from the Alliance had ever seen how much the city has changed. Imagine your home town being run by the same evil zombies that killed your best friend. And don't argue that the Forsaken aren't evil, I've done the Tarren Mill quests. Human experimentation, and torturing animals seems pretty evil to me.[/i]\r\n\r\nOrcs destroyed Stormwind. It's called a war. Deal with it. And do i need to remind you the way the orcs were treated after their initial attack of Azeroth? Slave camps, forced to hide into the mountains. Defeating your enemy is one thing but what the so called alliance did was in fact... hitleristic. So... alliance lost a city, the orcs almost lost their race. Yea clearly a fair trade. \r\n\r\n Fact is right now two characters are really really stupidly done in warcraft lore. King Varian ... who if you have read the comic, is initially a calm calculated warrior and doesn't hate the Horde (talking about Logosh). He understands his situation and deals the best he can with it. On the other side of the Varian is the Varian that returned to Stormwind. The fun Varian if you will. Strange but when the two merged they turned into this bumbling brute that resembles the other stupidly done character in WoW... Garrosh Hellscream. \r\n\r\nGarrosh is an orc that never touched demon blood. Acording to lore orcs were shamans and a peacefull race before the blood drinking. He is acting just like Grom did. At least Grom had the decency to obey the warchief despite not understanding the methods. (he only disobeyed after drinking blood the second time). Also Garrosh was a crying little @#$%^ when you first meet him. Fearing that he will end up like his father. He sees that his father managed to atone for part of his mistakes and turns into a carbon coppy of him?

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 141, "id": 1329917, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "147350", "body": "The First War\r\n\r\nVarian Wrynn was born to King Llane Wrynn in the Kingdom of Azeroth and as a youth lived a joyful and prosperous life as prince of Stormwind. But all that changed when the orcs appeared from beyond the Dark Portal and attempted to destroy his homeland, thus ushering in the First War between his beloved Kingdom of Azeroth and the Horde.\r\n\r\nAnduin Lothar, the Champion of Stormwind, rallied his countrymen and armies and gutted out a desperate attempt to hold the Horde at bay and to keep them away from King Llane, Varian, and Stormwind. While Lothar enjoyed some small success in holding back the Horde, his efforts were dashed when Garona Halforcen, who had become an ally to Stormwind, betrayed King Llane under orders from the Shadow Council and cut his heart out, giving it to Gul'dan. Varian could only watch helplessly as his father was murdered and the Horde overran his kingdom, burning its homes and slaughtering all who stood in their way. The death of his father affected him greatly, his later closest friend Arthas Menethil recalls him looking weary and ragged when he first sees him, and says that he'd \"lost absolutely everything but his life.\"\r\n\r\nExodus to Lordaeron\r\n\r\nAnduin Lothar, convinced that Stormwind could not be retaken, gathered Varian and all who remained in the city and led an escape from their homeland. Narrowly escaping by boat into the sea, they headed North while Lothar gathered his thoughts aboard his ship. Consulting with Varian and the Kirin Tor mage Khadgar, they determined that in order to preserve humanity from annihilation by the Horde they would need to warn King Terenas, ruler of Lordaeron, of the danger that loomed on the horizon.\r\n\r\nAfter landing at the port of Southshore Lothar gathered Prince Varian along with Khadgar and several knights and marched towards Lordaeron. Upon arriving young Varian was greeted by King Terenas, who treated him as an equal king despite Varian's young age. King Terenas quickly offered him his pledge to stand by him until his homeland was retaken and invited him to stay with him for as long as he was willing. Although at first Varian was slightly shy being in a Kingdom he had never seen before, he quickly overcame his timidity and Varian found King Terenas' son Arthas Menethil, who was just a few years younger than he, as a great new friend and the two quickly formed a close friendship. Shortly after he began staying in Lordaeron, King Terenas formed the Alliance of Lordaeron. Under the command of Anduin Lothar, its supreme commander, this alliance was finally able to put an end to the Horde reign during the Second War. However, the victory came at a great price as Anduin Lothar was killed shortly before the war ended and would not live to see the retaking of his Kingdom of Stormwind.\r\n\r\nFriendship with Arthas\r\n\r\nAfter taking up shelter in Lordaeron, Varian quickly became friends with Arthas Menethil who was anxious to meet another young prince.[8] Though most of the time he kept his composure, Varian once broke into tears as Arthas tried to console him about the assassination of his father. He was later recalled by Arthas as his \"best friend\" for much of their childhood and adult lives, and Varian frequently sparred with the less-athletic Arthas in an attempt to toughen him and make him a better paladin. They built up a friendly rivalry, and a year after Varian was crowned king, they met and sparred on the day of Arthas' ascension to the Order of the Silver Hand. Though not outwardly spiteful, Arthas frequently lamented that he was not as physically strong as Varian. During the later murder of King Terenas, Arthas recalled words that Varian once said about how King Llane was \"stabbed right through the heart\" moments before he plunged Frostmourne through his own father's heart. After Arthas' falling in with the Scourge and rise to become the new Lich King, Varian began to see him as the ultimate traitor to the Alliance. \r\n\r\nRise as king\r\n\r\nWith Stormwind retaken and slowly being rebuilt (thanks to King Terenas, who had urged the Alliance to help fund the rebuilding of Stormwind), Varian was officially crowned King of Stormwind at the age of eighteen. King Terenas himself was well-pleased with how Varian had grown into a clever and noble King, feeling a father's pride as he had grown attached to Varian over the years, considering Varian his second son. The Stonemasons, led by Edwin VanCleef, came to lend their help in rebuilding Stormwind and hoped to forge a new future for themselves, with aspirations that riches would soon follow their work's completion.\r\n\r\nDuring his reign as king, Varian left Stormwind City under the stewardship of the House of Nobles and traveled to the many corners of his kingdom to protect his people from raiding orc parties, meeting with spies who were searching for the assassin Garona, and directing the restoration of his kingdom. After many months Stormwind was finished, reborn as a kingdom of majesty and architectural brilliance eclipsing even its once-pristine condition before the First War. It was during this time of renewed tranquility that Varian would marry a young, beautiful woman named Tiffin and conceive a son, Anduin, named for Lothar.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Alliance soon began fracturing, and the elven Kingdom of Quel'Thalas, along with the human kingdoms of Stromgarde and Gilneas seceded. Despite this, King Varian vowed he would stand by King Terenas and the Alliance as they had stood by him in his time of need. It was also during this time that the Stonemasons who had rebuilt Stormwind demanded to be paid for their service to King Varian and the House of Nobles. However, the corrupt House of Nobles, under the influence of Katrana Prestor, refused to adequately pay the guild for its work. King Varian was unable to negotiate a resolution because the nobility held too much political power and outmaneuvered him repeatedly. Though the Stonemasons were compensated for their work, they received a fraction of the pay they had earned, and so Edwin VanCleef and the Stonemasons set to rioting in the streets of Stormwind, demanding just compensation. The riot was dangerous and chaotic and in the confusion Varian's young queen was brutally murdered. Edwin VanCleef fled Stormwind with the Stonemasons while Varian mourned Tiffin's death. He fell into a great depression but over time regained his determination and vowed to continue to create a new and better world for himself, his son and the people of Stormwind. \r\n\r\nThird war\r\n\r\nVarian was never seen during the Warcraft 3, though it is known that Stormwind had sent many troops to support Lordaeron during the Scourge assault. Varian agreed to give shelter to the Lordaeron refugees in Stormwind and send the armies of Stormwind to Hillsbrad to retake Southshore. It was also at this time the outpost of Chillwind Point was established between the now corrupt Plaguelands and Alterac. With the fall of Lordaeron, Varian had become the leader of the Alliance and Stormwind had become the strongest remaining human kingdom. \r\n\r\nAbduction\r\n\r\nAfter the dust had settled from the Third War, Varian journeyed to Theramore to speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore regarding Horde/Alliance relations. En route, he was abducted by the Defias who had been told of his diplomatic trip through a spy rumored to live within the Kingdom of Stormwind itself. Rumors circulated that he was taken to Alcaz Island and was held captive there.

But if peace means backing out and letting the enemy over-run her people, it seems pretty sensible that Jaina is helping the war effort.\n\n---\nOf course I've noticed, I did the quests in Southern Barrens because I was curious about all that was going on down there. It's been said that with Thrall giving the position of Warchief to Garrosh, Theramore has decided to cast away their unofficial peace treaty, so to say, with The Horde. I find it probable that Jaina agreed with the invasion as she was worried of what Garrosh might decide to do with Dustwallow Marsh, due to its close proximity to Horde territory. It would be very unlike her to agree with the citizens of Taurajo being killed, but, pray tell, is this not very similar to the situation at Hillsbrad Foothills? Camp Taurajo may never have attacked The Alliance but it did provide support to The Horde. The Forsaken wanted to strengthen their hold on Hillsbrad, and The Alliance wants to do that as well with Southern Barrens, in order to have a strategical piece of land against the vast Horde forces. I don't expect you to like that, but it is very reasonable from The Alliance's point of view, just like the attacks on our towns are reasonable from [i]your[/i] point of view. Edit: Who knows? Personally, I think she decided to just give up on the unofficial peace treaty since it would be unlikely that Garrosh would leave her and her forces alone, should they have never started invading Southern Barrens. If she was still going around preaching about how wrong war is and everything I'd call her a hypocrite, but I believe she has the \"I really wish that this whole war between us would end.\" feeling, which is what most people have; the whole \"war is a necessary evil\" bit. Some Forsaken aren't truly loyal to The Horde, but some of them are starting to consider themselves loyal Horde members, even if they don't follow the Horde's more traditional beliefs. I would say they are a part of The Horde, but that's just me.", "date": "2011-02-14T15:13:10-06:00", "rating": 7, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-02-22T16:29:58-06:00", 4, "783759"]}

It was more of a massacre than a battle in my view. And I honestly do not believe Taurajo posed a threat to the Alliance invasion, while Southshore was a major threat to Forsaken and Horde interests in southern Lordaeron. A supply port and military staging ground, which Varian was intending to use for an invasion of Lordaeron before its fall. \r\n\r\nI can understand Lady Jaina's new willingless to support the Alliance war effort. With a new warchief, aggressive in nature and still learning the ropes, she probably feels she has no choice. Though by ending the treaty I fear the Horde members who honored the agreement will feel betrayed, and rally to take up arms. As such because of what has happened, the new highway to the Southern Barrens and what Alliance troops did at Taurajo, the Horde will likely launch an all-out-assault on Theramore. In the end, Lady Jaina may have dug a grave, either for herself or Theramore. Though maybe Thrall will step in to save her. I think even after all this, they still consider each other friends, even if no longer having any chance at being allies as they preferred.\r\n\r\nSome people may say that Hillsbrad is worse than Taurajo because the Forsaken were experimenting on prisoners of war. But as quests at the Sludge Fields reveal, it was intended to just be a prison camp. The warden there was mentally unstable and even experimented on some of his own guards. In the end, he is executed by a fellow Forsaken and a player (and a rather odd blood elf, but that's not relevant right now) for his crimes.\r\n\r\nAnd it is true while at first the Forsaken only thought of the Horde as \"tools to use\", over time since the start of their alliance more and more Forsaken now see themselves as geniune members of the Horde, and are even proud of it too. Some see the Horde as outcasts, which they can relate too. Some orcs also share a sort-of bond with the Forsaken. As the Forsaken were slaves of the Scourge, the orcs were slaves of the Burning Legion. And now they are both free. Some orcs feel obliged to help a similarly liberated people.", "date": "2011-03-09T23:05:21-06:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-03-09T23:10:07-06:00", 1, "4dehorde"]}

Every Horde player I have ever spoken to doesn't know a damn thing about this guy.\r\n\r\nThe problem, I realize, is that Thrall has that legendary celebrity status offered to him by playing such a major role in Warcraft III, while the Human Campaign's primary protagonist turned out... well, to be the Lich King -_-;\r\n\r\nAs a Horde player, I realize I never got to partake in what I imagine was Wyrm's equivalent of Thrall's, and now Grommash's, early level gather-quests-that-are-somehow-cooler-because-they-came-from-the-Big-Guy.

But I mean, its Thrall ^_^ he is the man... er, the orc.  Still, they couldn't have squeezed Varian in to some epic content in Cataclysm at all?
