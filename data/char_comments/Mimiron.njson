Some guilds refer to him as the \"Shade of Aran\" of Ulduar, and once you reach him, it'll be easy to see why.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 is mostly a tank-and-spank, just have melee run out of the Shock Blast and heal up whoever gets napalm'd. Also have abilities like Shield Wall, Pain Suppression, and Guardian Spirit ready to ensure your tank lives through Plasma Blast (use one of each of these for each blast).\r\n\r\nPhase 2 is VERY healing-intensive. This part is essentially a gear-check for your healers. They have to keep up a raid which will be taking massive damage from Bursts and Heat Waves. Also something of a retard-check to avoid the Laser Barrages and Rocket Strikes.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 is a similar gear-check for your DPS. Select a ranged DPS (preferably a demo-lock with Soul Link) to tank the ACU. Select another ranged DPS to \"kite\" the Assault Bots (preferably your highest-damage hunter) while the rest of your DPS kill them as fast as possible. It's also a good idea to have a rogue put Crippling Poison on their offhand and shiv the Assault Bots as quickly as possible, to keep it snared. In case you're wondering why they're kited, lets just say they hit our main tank for 60,000. After dying, the assault bots drop a magnetic core which can be used to bring down the head, stun it, and cause it to take additional damage. If you kill the Assault Bots fast enough, you'll have a good 10-15sec to burn the boss before the next Assault Bot spawns. The junk bots can be easily tanked and AOEed once the phase is over.\r\n\r\nPhase 4 is basically a combination of all three previous phases, so as you could imagine, it's quite hectic. Split up your DPS among each of the three parts of the machine, while everyone keeps a close eye on the health of all three parts to ensure they will all die within seconds of each other. Whoever tanked the head phase 3 should do so again here. This part is partially luck-based (a Laser Barrage and Shock Blast at once will almost certainly kill some of your melee) and requires everyone to be very observant of when a Laser Barrage or Shock Blast is coming, which are the most dangerous parts of this phase.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 14, "id": 694646, "nreplies": 2, "sticky": 0, "user": "114759", "body": "In comparison with the other 3 keeper bosses (Hodir, Thorim, Freya), this boss is extremely difficult. It took my guild upwards of 12 hours of attempts to down him on 10-man. Here is some advice:\r\n\r\nThis is not the most melee friendly fight. Although you can certainly do it with a good amount of melee, it seems to go smoother if you only have one or two. We tried this boss with multiple group set-ups; here is the one we killed him with.\r\n\r\nFeral Druid (Tank)\r\n\r\nBoomkin, Hunter, Hunter, Mage, Warlock (Ranged DPS)\r\n\r\nEnhance Shaman (Melee DPS)\r\n\r\nHoly Pally, Resto Druid, Holy Priest (Healers)\r\n\r\nThe composition on this boss is flexible; no specific classes are needed. Although it may be possible to 2-heal this boss, we were unable to do so because of the plasma blasts in phase 1. \r\n\r\nThe most important thing to consider when selecting people for this fight is awareness. The challenge of this fight is avoiding the many ways you can die if you are not completely focused. With that in mind, it will take a while before your group members will get good at this fight. You'll probably wipe a lot on the first three phases before you get them perfect. Patience is key; repeated deaths on the same mechanic, however, should raise some eyebrows.\r\n\r\nIn phase 1, have your ranged DPS and healers spread out on one side of the boss. Once they have a spot they don't have to move for the rest of the phase. The boss will shoot a fire ball at one person that will put a DOT on them and they have to be healed through it. The boss does an ability called Plasma Blast that hits the main tank for 17,600 damage per second unmitigated for 5 seconds. The tank must be spam healed through this. A cooldown rotation is highly recommended for both the tank's cooldowns and any other mitigation cooldowns in the raid, such as Divine Guardian. With proper DPS you should only get 2 or 3 plasma blasts.\r\n\r\nHere is an example cooldown rotation for a feral tank's abilities: First blast barkskin. Second blast survival instincts and frenzied regeneration. Third blast barkskin.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the main raid killer in this phase is the boss's shock blast and mines. After each plasma blast (sometimes during a plasma blast if you have high DPS), the boss will do a shock blast. You can see him casting this ability, and when he does melee and the tank have to run away from him. The ability is an AOE that will one-shot anyone who doesn't run. It does less damage the further you run. The range is relatively small, only about 15 yards, so as long as you run you should live. While running out make sure you run through a gap in the mines surrounding the boss (he throws mines in a circle around him periodically). Although one mine is not life-threatening, two or more can kill you.\r\n\r\nYou can charge back in after the shock blast, but be aware that charge pathing can run you through mines if you aren't careful. If the run distance and timing are executed perfectly, a warrior or feral druid tank can keep the boss from moving when they charge back in.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of phase two, stay away from leftover mines; don't worry, they will explode by the start of the phase. Also, do not stand on the circle in the middle of the room; you will get thrown back when the floor opens up. On this phase the boss is untankable and will shoot a conal attack directed at one person. The conal attack will also hit anyone else near the person so ranged need to spread out. Melee DPS should continually run behind the boss each time he turns. The boss will also do an ability called Laser Barrage which follows the cast 'spinning up'. Similar to The Lurker Below's spout attack, anyone caught in front of the boss during this ability will be killed almost instantly; it deals about 18k damage every 0.5 seconds. his ability only goes 180 degrees and only goes in the direction the boss span up, so just run behind him. Melee should be careful not to stand too far into the boss's center or the barrage may clip them.\r\n\r\nThs boss will also shoot a rocket off his back. If you are the target of the rocket a flashing red circle will appear beneath your feet. You must run out of the circle or you will be one-shotted.\r\n\r\nIn phase 3, you will fight an aerial unit. A ranged DPS must tank this (we used a warlock). On this phase the tank should be picking up assault bots (which spawn from orange beams of light) and junk bots (which spawn from green beams of light). Assault bots will one-shot a non-tank so it is crucial that they are picked up ASAP; junk bots do not hit hard so if one is loose it is not a priority until assault bots are secured. All melee DPS should be on these bots while the command unit is in the air. Assault bots can be stunned, and will also do a channeled spell 'magnetic pull' that stuns the tank. This is interruptable.\r\n\r\nAssault bots drop an item called magnetic core (like the cores on Lady Vashj). One person should be assigned to pick these up and put them below the boss. This will pull the boss onto the ground; everybody should DPS him during this time. \r\n\r\nAll ranged should have a macro '/target Bomb Bot'. Bomb bots will spawn throughout this phase; they run very fast and will likely kill anyone they get to. Ranged must target them as soon as the bots drop through the air. They should be dead within a few seconds of hitting the ground so that they don't get near anybody; if a bomb bot is coming toward you run away. Assault and junk bots should be tanked away from where bomb bots land to avoid melee being blown up.\r\n\r\nAfter the command unit is down, kill any remaining bots and get into position (ranged spread out). The three machines will now combine and maintain some of their previous abilities. The bottom will still throw mines and shock blast, the middle will still do a conal attack, rockets, and laser barrage, and the top will still shoot plasma balls at its primary target. Each unit starts at 50% health . Melee are only capable of attacking the bottom and middle. All of these parts must be killed within 5 seconds of each other or they will self-repair. \r\n\r\nThe most challenging part of this phase is the laser barrage. With everything else going on it is easy for ranged and healers to not notice the barrage quickly enough and be caught in it; it can also be difficult to get away in time if the barrage faces directly at you. Everybody must remain aware for this phase. You must continue to avoid mines, shock blast, rockets, and laser barrage, while spreading out for the conal attack and paying attention to health %s as you burn the three parts down.\r\n\r\nTanking is very sensitive during this phase. It is important to move the boss as little as possible, and to reposition quickly after shock blast. Note that the boss can do shock blast and laser barrage right after each other; this is difficult to handle. During the laser barrage the bottom of the boss can be turned seperately from the middle so that the tank can avoid being hit.\r\n\r\nJust keep your cool and stay alive. The better your raid gets at living the sooner you will down this boss.\r\n\r\nBest of luck.", "date": "2009-04-26T09:11:20-05:00", "rating": 35, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "My group has been using this strategy (more or less) for 2 weeks now and we're able to survive until mana becomes a problem (which is usually after failing several times to kill all 3 parts at the same time in phase 4).

Even if you overgear this fight, everyone must play according to the tactics, because if one player fails, that soon becomes a raid-wide mistake. Furthermore, it is crucial that no one dies over the course of the fight. Every raid member will be an important asset if you hope to beat this Hard Mode. \n\nMost will already know, but to activate this Hard Mode you need to push the [url=http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/EXID26051/images/MIM%282%29.jpg]big red button[/url] in Mimiron's room. After wiping quite a few times, my group came up with a strategy. I haven't read many guides on this fight, so this is my contribution for anyone who wishes to get the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=3180]Firefighter[/url] [url=http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2957]Meta Achievement[/url]. In each phase section I will provide a description of what you will be up against, how to deal with it, and also a small separate explanation of the boss' abilities during each phase.\n\n[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] In between phases your group should stack at an assigned player near the wall, so that the fires will go to the back of the room and don't occupy precious space. Also, [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=48947]Fire Resistance Aura[/url] is gold here.\n\n[b][u]Phase 1[/u][/b]:\n\nDuring this phase Mimiron will be on a vehicle, the Leviathan Mk. This is the easiest of the four phases. We had two tanks, one Warrior and one DK. This made it much easier for the healers because since we didn't have a Druid tank. We had the OT taunt the boss when the MT was afflicted by [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=62997]Plasma Blast[/url]. Overall, ranged dps & the healers stayed close (with 6 yards between each other) and kept moving clockwise as the fire followed in their trail. It is wise to stay as close to the wall as possible so that the tanks have more space to move in case the middle is overrun with fire.\n\n[ul]\n[li]Abilities:[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63631]Shock Blast[/url]][u][/u][/b] > This ability takes 5 seconds to cast, and should ALWAYS be avoided by running away from the boss. If your tank(s) and melee get hit by this they will die. Warrior tanks can make good use of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=3411]Intervene[/url] to avoid it.\n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64529]Plasma Blast[/url]][s][/s][/b] > Everytime the boss uses this ability on the MT, the OT should taunt him or the MT will take an immense amount of damage. Cooldowns such as [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940]Hand of Sacrifice[/url] are also helpful to lessen the amount of damage the tank takes from the Plasma Blast.\n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63666]Napalm Shell[/url]][u][/u][/b] > This is the reason why healers and ranged must stay 6 yards from each other. The boss will cast it on a random ranged player, and if player Y is close to player X (the victim), he too will take damage from the Shell. \n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63027]Proximity Mine[/url]][u][/u][/b] > These will be spawned around the boss, and if not triggered by players, explode after roughly 30 seconds. One will not kill you, but if you trip over two or three things will go wrong, so be mindful of them.\n\n\n[b][u]Phase 2[/u][/b]:\n\nPhase two starts when Mimiron's Leviathan is defeated. He will now jump to a cannon-like machine, the VX-001. This phase will be pretty hard on your healers, and cannot be tanked, so the tanks should just focus on doing as much damage as they can. To reduce the damage the raid takes we divided the ranged into sub-groups. Group #1 (Warlock, Mage, R-Druid) and Group #2 (Boomkin n' Holy Priest). We decided that the groups should stay 20 yards apart so that only one of them would get hit by the cannon's shots, while moving when necessary due to flames & Laser Barrage. \n\n[ul]\n[li]Abilities:[/li]\n[/ul]\n[u][b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63293]Laser Barrage[/url]][/b][/u] > This ability will normally be cast once or twice during phase two. You can anticipate it by watching the boss [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63414]Spin[/url] and see where his faces his cannons: this attack is frontal cone-only, meaning the raid will need to behind the boss to avoid taking damage, which will result in death. This is this phase's most deadly ability.\n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63041]Rocket Strike[/url]][u][/u][/b] You will know where these will land by noticing the [url=http://static.wowhead.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/123628.jpg]red impact circles[/url] on the floor, similar to Hodir's ice. Getting hit by these will generally mean death. \n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64531]Rapid Burst[/url][u]][/u][/b] > This is why I suggest splitting the ranged into two groups. You will have to eat the damage, but it is also a frontal cone attack, so only one of the sub-groups has to take it.\n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63677]Heat Wave[/url][u]][/u][/b] > Raid-wide 'Fire Nova', unavoidable.\n\n\n[b][u]Phase 3[/u][/b]:\n\nPhase three is initiated after the defeat of the VX-001. This time Mimiron will jump to his Aerial Command Unit, which resembles his head. This phase cannot be tanked by melee since the boss is airbourne, meaning a ranged dps will have to tank. To do this, we had a warlock (me) spam [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=47815]Searing Pain[/url] to help build quick threat on the Aerial Unit. It is important for the raid to stay together in this phase so that the fires do not spread too much. Moreover, the tanks need to fast about picking up the adds so the ranged can dps the Aerial Unit with minimal fuss, while the melee destroy the adds. After you destroy the Aerial Unit, you will enter phase 4 We succeeded this way without pulling the 'Head' down.\n\n[ul]\n[li]Abilities:[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[b][[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63689]Plasma Ball[/url]][u][/u][/b] > This is the Aerial Unit's only attack, and it will be cast on your ranged 'tank'. One healer should be assigned to said tank due to this attack.\n\n[b][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33836#comments]Bomb Bot[/url][/b][b]|[/b][b][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=34057#comments]Assault Bot[/url][u][/u][/b][b]|[/b][b][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33855#comments]Junk Bot[/url][u][/u][/b], all these will spawn during p3 and must quickly be gathered by the tank(s). The most dangerous, the Bomb Bots, must either be killed by ranged or slowed by a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=45524]DK[/url] or a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=42917]Mage[/url].\n \n[b][u]Phase 4[/u][/b]:\n\nPhase 4 is, as you might expect, the hardest. In phase 4, for you will need to deal with all the previous vehicles' abilities when Mimiron unites them to form the V-07-TR-0N. This new robot will have Shock Blast, the Laser Barrage, and the Rockets. To make matters worse, the room will be overrun by fire and you will have little room to work with, not to mention you have an enrage timer to beat. It is now possible to reach this phase with good 4 minutes to spend, although it is unlikely your raid will last 4 minutes in phase 4. Survivability will become a serious issue here, and you must kill the V-07-TR-0N before he kills you. To succeed it is vital that all parts of the robot must die within seconds of each other, or they will repair and you will inevitably wipe.

Quite challenging and very enjoyable at the same time.  15 min enrage coupled with some fairly serious dmg in phases 1 and 4 made for a fine line between dps and survivability.

If you have less than 5 mins before the enrage going into the last phase you probably wont make it.  Phase 4 is actually easier to survive in then the first phase since you can get alot of self heals by targeting VX-001 and using HotR + SoI.  AW will help burn down the head in this phase, as combo of judgement, exorcism and HoW will bring down it HP fast.
