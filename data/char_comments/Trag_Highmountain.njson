One day, he stumbled upon the domain of one Valimar Mordis. Pleased by Mordis' welcome, Trag stayed and the two became friends.\r\n\r\nNot too long later, the Scourge attacked, killing all of Trag's friends at the barony. Somehow, Trag managed to escape and hide. Mordis returns to his home as a Forsaken, desiring revenge (as all good Forsaken do). He sets his eye on killing a Scourge leader (a ghoul) by the name of Ichor, in order to obtain a powerful artifact: The Orb of Ner'Zhul. With this orb, Mordis could reanimate powerful undead such as ancient behemoths or frost wyrms. \r\n\r\nA power source was needed to use the orb. Luckily (or unluckily, however you look at it), a young \"human\" woman arrived at Mordis' castle. Mordis planned to sacrifice her to utilize the power of the orb. Trag realized Mordis was not the same person he was before he turned and so he fought against Mordis and was defeated. As his final act, he shattered the orb, killing the wyrms and behemoths that had just been raised. The wyrms came crashing down upon the castle, killing Trag and Mordis.\r\n\r\nBut the story does not end there. Apparently, as the orb's final act, Trag was raised in undeath. He was driven mad by visions of Northrend and the Lich King. He returned to the shaman of his tribe, Sulamm. Promising to end his suffering, Sulamm put Trag in a trance and began to light a fire to incinerate Trag. He wakes up, realizes what is happening, and flees his tribe, heading toward Norhrend. \r\n\r\nThrall becomes aware of this Tauren's suffering and madness. He confronts Trag, telling him he can master his fear. Thrall says he will not fight Trag, and as Trag is about to strike Thrall, he realizes that he can help, as he truly does understand fear. He does not accepting lodging among the orcs yet, as he does not yet trust himself. Thrall gives him passage on a boat (yes, a boat) travelling north. Trag thanks him, and heads on his way. \r\n\r\nIn Northrend, Trag meets a Taunka who takes him into his village and ends up fighting off an attack on the village by the Scourge. \r\n\r\nHe continues towards Icecrown. He is trained as a Death Knight and put in charge of the attack on Icemist, but gains control again and attempts to assassinate the Lich King. Obviously he was not successful, but the odd thing is the he was not killed (or even worse), but only thrown out of Icecrown to be accepted as part of the Taunka.\r\n\r\nEdit: I read apost on the WoW forums making it sounds like he's going to have a part to play in Icecrown Citadel. This makes sense, seeing as how he was only cast out from the citadel rather than being killed by good ol' Arthas.", "date": "2009-08-12T13:04:22-05:00", "rating": 38, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-08-12T15:36:04-05:00", 1, "annanias"]}
