Only a united army founded on strength and courage can conquer the Legion. When you and your allies are prepared for the final battle, my echo will return to aid you.

About 800 years ago she fought the Avatar of Sargeras and defeated it, locking its body away in the underwater ruins of a night elf temple that would later become known as the Tomb of Sargeras. Unknown to her, Sargeras's soul left the Avatar and hid inside her womb.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian was supposed to give their power back to the Council for a new Guardian to be chosen, but Aegwynn didn't trust them. Instead she seduced a Stormwind court conjurer named [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=16524/shade-of-aran]Nieles Aran[/url], and after a one-night stand became pregnant. Her son, [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=15608/medivh]Medivh[/url], inherited her power as the Guardian of Tirisfal against the Council's wishes, but was also possessed by Sargeras who was hiding inside her womb. When Aegwynn discovered Sargeras's deception she confronted Medivh, but Medivh overpowered her and Aegwynn used the last of her power to teleport far away to Kalimdor. After Medivh's death, Aegwynn was the one who revived him pure of Sargeras.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=4968/lady-jaina-proudmoore]Jaina Proudmoore[/url] found Aegwynn in the Barrens about twenty years later.
