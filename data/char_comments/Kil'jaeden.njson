The triumvirate was approached by the fallen titan Sargeras, promising them power in exchange for loyalty.  Kil\u2019jaeden and Archimonde readily accepted while Velen and his followers (later known as draenei) refused and sought refuge with the naaru.  Kil\u2019jaeden corrupted the first orcs (assisted by Ner\u2019zhul and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17008]Gul\u2019dan[/url]) to serve as the Legion's army, leading to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10297]the opening of the Dark Portal[/url] and the First and Second Wars.  When the orcs failed to conquer Azeroth, he transformed Ner\u2019zhul\u2019s soul into the Lich King, charging him with the task of raising a mindless undead army to replace his depleted orc forces and triumph over the Alliance.

Anveena, Kalecgos, and the Blue Dragonflight play a role in this encounter.\r\n\r\nHe has five phases in which he gains new abilities in each phase. In phase 5 he does not get any more abilities, but casts them with greater frequency.\r\n\r\n Phase 1\r\nTo start the encounter, the raid will pull three Hands of the Deceiver. Unlike their counterparts in the Magtheridon encounter, they have a significant aggro range. They are linked and due to the nature of their abilities, it is recommended that they are dragged apart immediately after the pull, and tanked separately afterwards.\r\n\r\nAbilities:\r\n-  Melees for ~2K on a plate-wearer.\r\n- Can be stunned and silenced (above 20%).\r\n-  Shadow Bolt Volley: Deals 850 to 1150 shadow damage to all raid members within 30 yards, and places a stackable debuff that increases all shadow damage taken by 750.\r\n-  Soul Portal: Opens a portal that periodically causes Volatile Felfire Fiend to spawn; these imps will run towards nearby raid members and explode, dealing significant damage to all nearby characters. The imps have extremely low health (~400), and can be killed with a single instant cast spell ; however, dying also causes them to explode.\r\n-  Shadow Infusion: At 20% health, the Hand will gain this and it makes him immune to stun and silence effects.\r\n\r\nOnce all three Hands are defeated, Phase 2 begins. \r\n\r\nPhase 2\r\n\r\nKil'jaeden will emerge from with the middle of the room when phase 2 begins. Upon emerging, he will knock back all players that are standing within the glowing circle in the middle of the room. This causes no damage. \r\n\r\nHe initially has the following abilities; \r\n- Soul Flay - 3 second channel. Deals 3000 Shadow damage per second and reduces movement speed. Not resistable or dispellable.\r\n- Legion Lightning - 2 second cast. A chain lightning-like ability that hits the first target for 3007 to 3493 Shadow damage and then leaps to 4 additional targets, inflicting diminishing Shadow damage to each successive target. It will also drain 1500 mana from each character that takes damage from it. The range for the initial lightning and each successive jump is 50 yards, so it cannot be realistically outranged. Fully resistible.\r\n - Fire Bloom - Instant cast. Places a debuff on up to five random targets that deals 1619 to 1881 Fire damage to the debuffed player and all other raid members within 10 yards. Lasts 20 seconds. Only can be dispelled with Immunity effects such as Ice Block and Divine Shield. \r\n- Summon Shield Orb - Spawns a Shield Orb add that is similar to Doom Blossoms in the Teron Gorefiend encounter. Since they only have 20k hp, it is recommend that they be killed as soon as they appear. During Phase 2, they will always spawn northeast of Kil'jaeden, and then orbit him counterclockwise. \r\n\r\nOnce Kil'jaeden reaches 85% HP, Phase 3 will begin. \r\n\r\nPhase 3\r\n\r\nWhen phase 3 begins, Kil'jaeden gains the following abilities:\r\n\r\n- Sinister Reflection: Used at the beginning of Phase 3, instant cast. Spawns five Sinister Reflections of a randomly targetted raid member that look identical to the target, and have the abilities of the target's class. These abilities are not tied to the character's talent build or gear selection. Their melee attacks deal an incredible amount of physical damage (2k on plate) and their casts do considerable damage/healing. They cannot be CC'd, but do have normal threat mechanics.\r\n- Shadow Spike: 28 second channel. Bombards randomly targeted raid members with Shadow Spikes that function like Void Reaver's orbs, floating towards the target's position upon the moment of cast and exploding. The explosion inflicts 5100 to 6900 Shadow damage to all characters within 8 yards, and places a debuff that reduces all healing effects by 50% by 10 seconds. Resistable.\r\n- Flame Dart Explosion: Instant cast. Every 3 seconds, all raid members will be hit by Flame Darts that cause 1663 to 1837 Fire damage and reduce movement speed by 50%. Lasts 15 seconds. Resistable, but not dispellable.\r\n- Summon Shield Orb: This ability will now cause two Shield Orbs to spawn instead of one. They will initially appear on opposite sides of the room, and will rotate in opposite directions.\r\n- Darkness of a Thousand Souls: Kil'jaeden will emote (Kil'jaeden begins to channel dark energy) and then cover himself with his wings. After 8 seconds, he will hit all players for 47500 to 52500 Shadow damage. This must be countered by Shield of the Blue.\r\n\r\nOnce Kil'Jaeden reaches 50% HP, phase 4 will begin\r\n\r\nPhase 4\r\n\r\nKil'Jaeden gains one more ability in this phase and will now summon three shield orbs.\r\n\r\n- Meteor: Meteors fall from the sky, hitting anyone within a 5 yard range for a fatal amount of damage. There is a Hellfire graphic that appears about 5 seconds before the meteor lands, giving time to move out of the landing area. 3 meteors will be in flight constantly throughout this phase. However, Meteor bombardments will stop while he is casting Darkness of a Thousand Souls.\r\n- Summon Shield Orb: Kil'jaeden will now summon three shield orbs instead of two. \r\n\r\nUpon Kil'Jaeden reaching 25% HP, phase 5 will begin.\r\n\r\n Phase 5\r\n\r\nWhen phase 5 begins, Kalecgos will cry out to Anveena, and she will \"awaken\" out of Kil'Jaeden's control, sacrificing herself into the Sunwell, stunning Kil'Jaeden for 5 seconds . Kil'Jaeden gains no new abilities this phase but cast all his previous abilities with greater frequency and suffers the following buff:\r\n\r\n- Sacrifice of Anveena: Kil'jaeden takes 25% increased Holy damage. \r\n\r\nAlong with all abilities being casted with greater frequency, two of his abilities are changed in this phase;\r\n- Soul Flay lasts for 8 seconds now\r\n- Meteors will continue to bombard the raid when he casts Darkness of a Thousand Souls.\r\n\r\nKalecgos\r\n\r\nKalecgos plays an important part in this encounter, being that starting in phase 3, he empowers the 4 orbs in the room, that when used (Only one member can use each orb) transforms the raid member into a blue dragon with the following abilities;\r\n - Blink: Teleports the dragon 20 yards forward. \r\n- Breath: Revitalize: Breathes arcane energy in a 13-yard cone in front of the caster, causing friendly units to regenerate 2250 health and mana over 10 sec. 10 second cooldown.\r\n- Breath: Haste: Breathes arcane energy in a 13-yard cone in front of the caster, increasing the attack, casting, and movement speeds of friendly targets by 25% for 30 sec. Also grants immunity to effects that reduce movement speed. 10 second cooldown.", "date": "2008-05-30T22:45:04-05:00", "rating": 106, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Here is the link to his dummy [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=25735]\"Meteor\"[/url] ability", "creationdate": "2008-10-23T10:55:54-05:00", "id": 356442, "rating": 3, "commentid": 297345, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "132850", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

The health bar shows how much you are near to the end of the fight and when Maiev will come.\r\n\r\nThe health bar of Algalon shows you how long until you convince him to \"spares your world\"... If he did not do so then you could have go on forever and the Titans already destroyed Azeroth.\r\n\r\nThis is same to Kil'jaeden, you've barely even hurt him!

Yes, you can just walk right around the edge of Kalecgos's circle.\n\n[b]Brutallus[/b] Ok, so after a few unsuccessful tries of having my paladin tank while my hunter friend burned him down didn't work due to heavy tank damage and my resto shaman having terrible gear, I remembered hearing about a BM hunter who tanked argaloth with his pet since it avoids meteor slash.\n\nSo my friend went BM and grabbed his level 83 turtle pet, went ret with my paladin, tossed ES on the turtle, and killed him this way. The hunter kept mend pet up, and I had to toss some healing waves at the pet.\n\n[b]Felmyst[/b] Super easy, tanked with my prot paladin and dispelled with my resto shaman, dodge breath, collect loot, etc.\n\n[b]Eredar Twins[/b] For this fight I lured Lady Sacrolash up the ramp while my hunter friend burned down Grand Warlock Alythess. My paladin didn't require much healing from my shaman aside from earth shield, so i mainly focused on healing my shaman and the hunter. Got a little hairy at the end when we were hitting 20 stacks of the healing debuff.\n\n[b]M'uru/Entropius[/b] I tried going ret for the extra damage, but when it came to picking up all the melee adds, you just can't beat prot since their damage adds up with all the shadow aoe going on(plus remember? my shaman's gear sucks!) Purge the Dark Fiends when they spawned so we didn't take more shadow aoe damage. It got a little crazy at the end but we didn't really know this encounter's abilities very well.\n\n[b]Kil'jaeden[/b] Since most of his damage is magic, and you have 9.4M HP to burn through, I went ret on my paladin. This fight was actually one of the easiest ones in here. With Resist Aura and the Healing Stream glyph to cover shadow/fire/nature resists, healing was pretty light. \n\nKept ES on my ret paladin which helped for when I was gathering up the sinister reflections. My hunter friend took out the Shield Orbs, not sure how much damage they really did. Other raid damage was fairly light due to our resist abilities making most of the shadow bolts and chain lightnings fully resist.\n\nWhen it came to KJ's Darkness of a Thousand Souls ability, we didn't bother using the drakes. It took about half of our HP each cast, so a couple big heals brought us back to higher health. Aside from that it was a pretty simple fight.\n\nAnd for the couple hours of work we put in, my hunter friend was awarded with his legendary bow. Now to make him pass on Ashes of Al'ar when they finally drop for us!\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that I am a pretty bad dual boxer, I have no special addons, so I have to click between my two monitors to change between my paladin and shaman. So if you can drag along 2 friends, fights like M'uru should be much easier.", "date": "2011-03-22T18:57:02-05:00", "rating": 5, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-03-22T19:02:16-05:00", 1, "jswaim1986"]}

You can either take the damage, while using AMS, Cloak of shadows, etc. to reduce the damage or use an activated Dragon Orb on the edge of the room.

He will summon floating orbs in the sky that shoot shadow bolts at your party, that can (and should) be targeted and killed very easily. He also constantly knocks back anyone within melee range all fight long, casts flame dart which deals damage and slows you, among many other magical damage abilities.\n\nHe will summon adds called \"Sinister Reflection\" throughout the fight that will look like a random party member, and should be taken down quickly.\n\nAny questions feel free to ask hope this helps you get your achievements/transmog gear/legendary bow! :)\n\nFull video of the fight with instructional commentary on YouTube: http://youtu.be/GanItZ2NGd4", "date": "2012-03-25T15:52:57-05:00", "rating": 6, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-03-25T15:54:09-05:00", 1, "TdarKoNe"]}
