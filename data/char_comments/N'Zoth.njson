Within that, I've noticed that there is not really a standard terminology for entering the portal, and leaders either use \"X group down, Y group up\" to refer to who should enter the portal or not, with up and down being kind of interchangable.\n\nMy advice would be, instead of telling people to go up or down, simply say \"Group X [b][i][u]STAYS[/u][/i][/b] (for non portal players who will be killing eyeballs and tentacles with one of the tanks and Group Y [i][b][u]GOES[/u][/b][/i] (for players who will be entering the portal to kill the big add.

In today's day and age, you unfortunately can't (realistically) expect a PUG group, let alone an LFR group, to look up the fight. I agree, it is your own responsibility to learn mechanics.

Each one removes a buff from the NPC, effectively making it easier for lower geared players. For example, on the floating platforms at 57,49, there are on the same platform as an Elite Executor of N'Zoth, and one facing the highest platform. You can remain flying whilst clicking on them.\n\n[ol]\n[li]clicking on the lower one whilst Executor of N'Zoth is active makes him say \"I cannot taste the Blood of N'Zoth\" coursing through my veins, how can this be so\". This removes the \"[b]Blood of N'Zoth[/b]\" buff from the NPC. This is a 5% buff to healing, and makes players leave pools of acidic blood if they crit hit the NPC.[/li]\n[li]clicking on the middle sigil, whilst Executor of N'Zoth is active makes him say \"I no longer feel the Presence of N'Zoth... Have I been foresaken?\". This removes the \"[b]presence of N'Zoth[/b]\" buff from the NPC. This is a 10% speed buff. The other sigils despawn, and none return whilst the mob is still active.  [/li]\n[li]clicking on most north westerly sigil first whilst Executor of N'Zoth is active makes him say \"Who dares defile the flesh of N'Zoth\". This removes the \"[b]Flesh of N'Zoth[/b]\" buff on him, which is 20% HP.
