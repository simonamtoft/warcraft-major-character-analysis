When Illidan was captured after trying to make a second Well of Eternity, Maiev was assigned to guard him. After he escaped and was corrupted by the Skull of Gul'dan, Maiev decided that he was too dangerous and vowed to find him and lock him away again.\r\n\r\nMaiev chased Illidan across Azeroth to the tomb of Sargeras, where Illidan caved the tomb in, in an attempt to trap Maiev and her Watchers. Sort of like payback for them keeping him locked up. Maiev used her powers to teleport out and left her trapped Watchers in the tomb to die.\r\n\r\nMaiev joined up with Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage and continued to chase Illidan after that. After reaching Lordaeron, they split up with Malfurion and Tyrande and Maiev met up with Kael'thas Sunstrider. The three of them were attacked by undead, Tyrande managed to fend them off but was swept away in the river. Maiev stopped Kael from saving her so that they wouldn't lose time. \r\n\r\nShe then lied to Malfurion and told him Tyrande had been torn apart and that it was Illidan's fault so that Malfurion would get mad and help her defeat Illidan. Which they did, stopping Illidan from destroying the Lich King in the process. Kael'thas told Malfurion that Tyrande hadn't been torn apart, only swept away in the river and he turned on Maiev, entangling her in roots.\r\n\r\nAfter Illidan and Malfurion rescued Tyrande, they let Illidan go and he escaped into the Dark Portal. Maiev, pretty much driven mad by her thirst for vengeance at this point, gathered her Watchers and followed Illidan into Outland.\r\n\r\nThey managed to capture Illidan but Kael and Lady Vashj helped free him and Maiev was imprisioned.\r\n\r\nWhen you fight Illidan in The Burning Crusade, near the end of the fight Maiev shows up and helps you defeat Illidan, finally ending her long, drawn out hunt across worlds.\r\n\r\nLast thing Illidan says as he dies is \"The Huntress is nothing without the hunt.
