When the capital of Gilneas was attacked by feral worgen, Crowley was released by Gilnean adventurers and convinced to give aid to Greymane, who had ordered the evacuation of Gilneas. In order to divert the worgen's attention from the fleeing citizens, Crowley led a group of sane Gilneans to stand against them at Light's Dawn Cathedral. Crowley and his followers were overwhelmed, and became worgen themselves.\n\nSoon afterward, Lord Crowley began capturing feral worgen in the woods of the Blackwald, trying to make them sane. As the Forsaken invasion went on, Genn Greymane asked Crowley for help. Due to Lord Godfrey's command, Darius refused, but when Greymane revealed that he too had succumbed to the worgen curse, Darius agreed to join forces.\n\nWith Gilneas now in enemy hands following the Forsaken invasion, Lord Crowley lead the Gilneas Liberation Front against the Forsaken in Silverpine Forest. With help from the 7th Legion, who used a submarine to pass the enemy lines, the Alliance gained the upper hand in Gilneas. However, agents of the Horde ended up destroying some the reinforcements and enabled the Forsaken to resurrect Lord Godfrey as one of their own, a fact that none of the Gilneans were aware of.\n\nWith Godfrey's help the Forsaken successfully captured Darius's daughter Lorna. Sylvanas Windrunner herself rode out to meet with Darius at the shattered Greymane Wall and gave him two choices - the surrender of the Gilneas Liberation Front, or Lorna's death and resurrection as one of the Forsaken. Without a moment of hesitation, Darius agreed to surrender in order to protect his daughter. Sylvanas allowed them to flee to Gilneas, which was still contested between the Alliance and the Horde.", "date": "2011-01-23T06:34:15-06:00", "rating": 6, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-07-07T03:36:48-05:00", 1, "Tyowinn"]}
