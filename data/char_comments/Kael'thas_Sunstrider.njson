This Mob is slower than Run speed but will kill anyone with a single blow if in melee range. \r\n\r\nGaze Ability (A Fixate) -- Targets a specific person and walks towards them in an attempt to bring targeted person into melee range \r\nKnockback ( ~4-5k Damage) -- Mainly happens to Gazed Person but has potential for others, will throw person into air hurtling them at a wall, most of the time no fall damage is incurred but the initial damage of ~4-5k is enough. \r\nLord Sanguinar the second advisor of four. Recommend using a Tank on this mob. He runs faster than Run Speed. \r\n\r\nFear (30 Yard AoE ) \u2013 Will cast on a predictable timer, everyone in range will be feared. \r\nGrand Astromancer Capernian the third advisor of four. Recommend Ranged in Fire Resistance build Hate before raid engages. \r\n\r\nFireball (~6-7K Fire Damage(Mitigatable)) \u2013 Cast on person with highest agro consecutively. \r\nConflagrate (~800-1100 Per Tick, 10 Second Duration) \u2013 Cast on raid, Will hit multiple targets, based on proximity. \r\nArcane Explosion (A lot of Damage) \u2013 Triggered by people or pets in melee range \r\nMaster Engineer Telonicus the fourth advisor of four. Tanked by a single tank, melee on opposite side. Everyone must be aware of who has Toy. \r\n\r\nBomb ( ~7-9k AoE) \u2013 Thrown repeatedly, This is a Frontal Cone attack. \r\nRemote Toy ( ~0 damage ) \u2013 1 minute Timer on Debuff, Will stun for ~4 seconds per proc. Multiple procs during 1 minute duration. All hate is ignored while Stun is active. \r\n\r\nPhase 2 \r\nPhase 2 starts once Telonicus dies. Kael'thas summons the Advisors' weapons and you will have to fight them simultaneously :\r\n\r\n[Cosmic Infuser]\r\n\r\n[Devastation_(Weapon)]\r\n\r\n[Infinity Blade]\r\n\r\n[Netherstrand Longbow]\r\n\r\n[Phaseshift Bulwark]\r\n\r\n[Staff of Disintegration] \r\n\r\n[Warp Slicer]\r\n\r\nUpon Death the weapon is lootable for ~60 seconds letting users of that specific weapon loot and equip.

Will turn into a Phoenix Egg when they die, and this egg will resurrect the phoenix if not killed within roughly 15 seconds. \r\nFlame Strike ( ~2k+ per second ) \u2013 Spell Detail level to High in order to see these, Similar to Void Zones they do damage per second you stand in them. Once initial spell is cast damage will persist until the floor no longer glows. \r\nShield (20K or greater health) \u2013 Shield stops melee from interrupting Pyroblasts, can cause issues if not DPSed down fast enough. \r\nMind control ( 1 Minute Duration ) \u2013 Typically in groups of two, casters, melee, and healers will get Mind controlled. No extra damage is applied when damaging raid but healers can buff, and heal Kael for Ridiculous amounts, one of the legendary weapons is designed to break this. \r\nArcane explosion (~100-600 Arcane Damage) \u2013 Nominal and easy to heal through it is a periodic damage that hits zone wide. \r\n\r\nPhase 5 \r\nKael'thas adds spells to his repertoire \r\n\r\nGravity Lapse \u2013 All members of raid are Teleported to him and shot into the air, everyone can \u201cSwim\u201d and needs to get away from each other. At the end of this ability the raid will fall to the ground and take fall damage. \r\nNetherbeam (Chains damage and increases as it hops) \u2013 A Chain lightning attack, will bounce through people too close and amplify in damage, otherwise it will just hit single people and do minimal damage. \r\nNether Vapor - Appear as small black clouds floating around in the air with you.

It will consist of two wings, a 25-man raid and a 5-man instance with both normal and heroic modes. Nevertheless, the instances will both most likely be outside, similar to other outdoor instances (Zul'Farrak and Zul'Gurub for example).\r\n\r\nThe 25 man raid of Sunwell Plateau will consist of 6 bosses where players will find blood elves reigniting the powers of the Sunwell with crates brought in from Netherstorm from the Manaforges.

The best use of your limited time is to aoe as many weapons as possible.  Only two weapons can't be practically grouped for AoE, those being the axe and bow.  The axe being left over isn't a big deal, since it doesn't provide critical buffs like other weapons.  The bow can be handled to the side by two ranged DPS.  Ideally this job goes to ranged DPS with high armor, meaning hunters or moonkin.  The rest of the raid focuses on AoE.  Have some kind of melee assigned to tank each weapon in the aoe cluster to avoid aggro mishaps.  Any weapon dragged out of the pile is not just a danger to the clothie that pulled, but precious lost AoE DPS.  Consecrate or cleave is not enough to deal with the maximum potential of seed of corruption, so every weapon should have a tank dedicated to that weapon alone.  Give the true tanks the sword, daggers, and shield, then go down the list to DPS warriors, rogues, etc for the mace, and staff.  Make sure paladins are aware the staff tank will benefit from blessing of freedom.  If you use AoE to its full potential while keeping the weapons piled, they will go down quickly.

Edit: Several other specs and classes have unique and proven ways of doing it now too - the other comments are very helpful with this.\n\n If not, you may want to take 4-5 people (and use the normal strategy). It can probably be done with 2-3 people, but it will be hard.\n\n[B]Credit to Raegwyn of Zuluhed EU for the awesome strategy[/B]\nCredit to Daviesh for the map image template.\n\n[B]Diagram: (IMPORTANT)[/B] http://img19.%^&*!@#$%^&*!/img19/2672/tempestkeeptheeye.jpg\n\n[B]Phase 1[/B]\nBegin the fight by walking to [U]Point A[/U] on the diagram. Kael'thas will start his RP. Quickly run to the bottom left exit of the room (near Point C), and run all the way back to the beginning of the instance ([U]Point B[/U]).\n\nThaladred the Darkener will make his way to you. Tank him in a corner because he has a move called [URL=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=36966\"]Psychic Blow[/URL], which is a knockback.\n\nLord Sanguinar will come up next. Bandage yourself in between Thaladred and Sanguinar if you have time. Lord Sanguinar's only real ability to watch for is his fear.\n\nAfter you kill Lord Sanguinar, quickly run to [U]Point C[/U]. Grand Astromancer Capernian will start attacking you along the way, just avoid her. When you get to Point C, duck into one of the corners of the room, LoSing her. Make sure you are against a wall but still in melee range. Her [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=36970]Arcane Burst[/URL] has a knockback plus slow, so it can be very hard to get back to her if you get knocked away. She also uses [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=37018]Conflagration[/url] which will incapacitate you for 10 seconds, allowing her to wail away at you. Use class abilities to prevent or escape it (Raegwyn pre-emptively AMS'd it).\n\nAfter you kill Grand Astromancer Capernian, proceed post-haste to [U]Point D[/U]. Master Engineer Telonicus will engage you. His only ability of note is [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=37027]Remote Toy[/url], a debuff which periodically stuns you for a few seconds. It lasts for one minute and is extremely annoying, but probably won't kill you.\n\n[B]Phase 2[/B]\nQuickly run back to [U]Point C[/U] to intercept the weapons that spawn. Use AoE attacks to take them down and spam self-healing abilities to keep yourself alive. Use DPS cooldowns here (and survivability cooldowns if needed). There will likely be 1 or 2 weapons still alive when Phase 3 begins. \n\n[B]Phase 3:[/B]\nNo running around. This time, the mobs run to YOU. There will be 1 or 2 weapons up from the previous phase (unless you're amaaazzzing or something), but don't worry about it (especially if it is the shield, it is weak).\n\nGrand Astromancer Capernian will be the first to come to you. Master Engineer Telonicus will come next. Lord Sanguinar will come third. Lastly, Thaladred the Darkener will make his appearance.\n\nFinish them off the same way you did in Phase 1.\n\n[B]Phase 4:[/B]\n[I]The hardest part of this phase is the Mind Control. Because you are soloing the fight, the Mind Control will not activate UNLESS there is another friendly target alive in the raid zone. You cannot have a Shadowfiend, a Ghoul, a Hunter pet, a Warlock pet, a Water Elemental, the Guardian of Ancient Kings, or EVEN BLOODWORMS active or he will reset to 100% hp when he Mind Controls you, ending combat and wasting a huge amount of time.[/I]\n\nQuickly run to [U]Point E[/U], LoSing Kael'thas using the stairs.\n\nKael'thas has several abilities. For his standard attacks, he alternates between melee swings and chain-casting Fireball. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=36805]Fireball[/url] is a slow cast which is interruptable. If you are a class with multiple interrupts, feel free to use interrupts (Mind Freeze) on the Fireballs to lessen the damage taken, but always have a spare interrupt available for Pyroblast (Strangulate).\n\n[url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=36819]Pyroblast[/url] is a move he casts every 60 seconds, usually right after [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=36815]Shock Barrier[/url] (which is similar to the Twin's Shield that the Val'kyr Twins use in ToC). Use any damage reduction cooldown to reduce the impact of the first Pyroblast (besides Guardian of Ancient Kings, obviously). From then on, try to eliminate the Shock Barriers before he finishes casting, so you can interrupt the Pyroblast.\n\nThe last part of Phase 4 is the Phoenix. Kael'thas will summon Phoenixes periodically. They do a medium amount of damage and should be killed, but priority remains on interrupt Kael'thas' casts over DPSing it. Try to use DoTs until it goes into egg form. It will also slowly kill itself. After they die, they go into egg form, in which they will be reborn if you do not DPS it down fast enough.\n\n[B]Phase 5[/B]\nAt 50%, Kael'thas will run away and -attempt- to go back to his room. Take this time to bandage if you want. He will stop at [U]Point C[/U] and summon you (after a minute or so). Ignore him and air-swim/run all the way back to [U]Point E[/U], LoSing him the same way you did in Phase 4. Continue to DPS him as advised in Phase 4.\n\nWhen he casts Gravity Lapse a second time, remain at a distance from him until the effect ends. Do not at any cost go within 8 yards of Kael'thas until he has stopped channeling Gravity Lapse. If you do, you will get tons of stacks of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=35859]Nether Vapor[/url] and die, painfully.\n\nRinse and repeat for great success!\n\nEnjoy!", "date": "2010-11-20T05:10:38-06:00", "rating": 35, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This does not count as a solo since it was done on the beta servers.

Answer is definetly and ill say how.\nMy group is based on a Ret. Paladin. , DPS Death Knight , And Frostmage.\nPhase1 is pretty straight forward , kill those .\nWeapon Phase , Mage (me) Killed the staff , took it and placed protective field on all of us , kill all weapons etc..realy easy with 3dps to kill them fast.\nThe \"tricky\" part is when they all Spawn. How we dealt with this is trivial . \nMarked in the order of the damage dealt to the raid. \n*1.The Mage solo`ed the Female fast ( Ive used Ice barrier and mage ward whenever on CD with IV popped). You should be taking any dmg at all , but make sure your Deep Freeze is off Cooldown cause it crits for 100k .\n*1.The Ret paladin and DK killed Lord Sanguinar first  . We found this dude dealing high dmg to the melee DPS so here the RET pala used his Heal at 3 Holy Power aswell as the DK used his Abilities to gain health.\n*2.Then  the Engineer ( Make sure you move out of the bombs if possible , its realy important since it deals a high ammount of dmg )\n*3.The slowed one , this should be kited so it doesnt hit ppl.\n\nThe next phase : Only problem here is mindcroll which isnt a problem at all :)\nTip : We used PvP trinkets . If myself (Mage) was MC`ed i instaly trinketed it , if the 2nd time i would of got MCed Iceblocked and imediatly after followed by Cooldsnap to have Iceblock again. Paladin was using his Trinket and Bubble to break it. And the DK just had the PvP trinket.\nThis phase imo is the easiest one , when you enter this phase make sure the DK uses army , Paladin uses Guardian for DMG , Mage uses IV + Time Warp and you have to get off him abut 1.25million if im not mistaken to enter last phase . He goes down realy fast with 3 DPS.\n\nLast phase is burndown phase , even if 1 dies its realy no problem. We usualy had 1 dying because of the pyro (it can be avoided if you have DK shield off cd and if mage is properly shielded and has Ward). Paladin can use the shield tho and he should when he casts pyro.\n\nThats all ( KInda )\na.)Make sure you make use of the Legendary staff( Especialy for the Remote Toy from the engineer !) , Shield and whatever you can since it makes your life easier.\nb.)Also for fellow mages if trying this comp have your Ice Barrier 24/7 Active aswell as your mage ward.\nc.)Paladin has the 3 Holy Power heal which is extremly usefull , use it dont *!@#$ on dps and heal your raid (Dead dps is no dps)\nd.)Use buffs of the Ah , especialy the Health Buff , buy a scroll 5g (Helps %^&*loads) and if you feel that you lack dps , pop a flask and a fish feast !\ne.)Make item switch macros so you can easily switch in fight between staff and your normal weapons , aswell as the paladin switch the shield for his Two Hander.\nHope i didnt miss something that was realy important.\n\nHope this was helpful , enjoy and GL getting the mount.\n\nPS: im 100% certain that other comps work so try it !", "date": "2011-01-11T12:47:29-06:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-01-11T12:58:46-06:00", 5, "580979"]}

I put my fire totem on the staff during this phase to speed up the DPS.  Next we killed the staff, dagger, shield (in that order) and finally finished off the rest of the weapons.  It is important they're all down BEFORE the next Phase, but not critical.\n\n[b]Phase 3:[/b] I think phase 3 is the toughest, but since we had so much DPS they went down faster then their damage output. During this phase I equipped the staff and used it to make us immune. We killed the mage first, as she causes the most trouble.  Next, the engineer, as his bombs/toys are quite annoying.  Finally, we killed the other two.\n\n[b]Phase 4:[/b] This phase can be difficult, but once the mechanics are understood it is arguably the easiest phase.  Our tank equipped the dagger (to break MC) and the shield to mitigate the pyro damage.  He used the shield during the first one and we interrupted the second. During this phase all three of us focused on the boss and ignored the phoenixes; it is important to DPS him fast when he does the Pyroblast as he also puts a shield on himself which makes him immune to interrupts.  We also all tried to interrupt all his firebolts.\n\n[b]Phase 5:[/b] This phase is fairly straightforward as well and reminiscent of the final fight in Magister's :P.  When he does his gravity lift it is important to RUN out as far as possible- he puts a stacking debuff which lowers everyones health dramatically.  During this part, I killed the phoenixes and we all made sure our hp was topped off.  When his shield goes down, just burn him fast, in the future I will use heroism during this phase.\n\nI think many other comps could easily 3-man this boss.  Having a warrior tank seems like the only way this is possible with only 3 people; as the MCs MUST be broken.  Possibly a druid tank that could switch out may work.. but it would be tough. It also may be possible with two dps + 1 healer.  This took us 6 attempts; and we finally downed him on the 6th AFTER I switched from resto to ele.  We probably could've downed him with me as resto as at that point we understood the fight better. However, the problem with having a healer, is during the MC phase, it is hard for the tank to quickly break the MC and thus the boss ends up getting healed.

First two phases are tank and spank, Ele Shaman grabs the staff to prevent conflag/arcane disruption from Kael'thas. We killed Thaladred first in P3 followed by Telonicus (because of the Toy debuff) then Capernian followed up by Sanguinar.\n\nWhen P4 started we both hid behind one of the giant Kael'thas statues in the room while I made sure I wasn't at 100% HP when Kael'thas became active. When he become active, I hit a Rune Tap to get agro on him while being out of LoS of him so he'd run to us (didn't have to run out there). When he got in agro range, the Ele Shaman was out of LoS on the other side of the pillar while I DPS'd down Kael'thas (making sure the staff buff stays up), after about 30 seconds or so Kael'thas will do a yell signaling he tried to MC, but due to LoS, it didn't work. This gave the Ele Shaman a free 15-20 seconds of DPS time (we played it safe as we weren't sure the exact timer on the MC). Just make sure to avoid the flame strikes as it still hits really hard (110k~) and use CDs on the first two Pyroblasts and interrupt the third.\n\nRinse and repeat with LoS and keeping the staff buff up and once you get to P5 the fight is easy. I imagine you could do this with anyone who can use a staff (though p3 might be a bit rough damage wise due to the stuns/fears/rends/etc) so I'd def recommend bringing someone who can heal.\n\nHope this helps others who are trying to 2 man this as being able to LoS the MC takes out the only difficult part of the fight (imo).", "date": "2011-02-11T21:02:59-06:00", "rating": 4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-02-11T21:06:55-06:00", 1, "Ryley"]}

Parachute cloak, Synapse Springs and Nitro Boosts enchants[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nStrat is basically the same as Raegwyn's video from beta.\n\n[b]Phase 1:[/b] Engage KT. Run out of the room and all the way to the beginning of the instance. The doors to KT's room don't close until the first Advisor activates. Thaladred is first. Tank him right by the raid entrance door with your back to the wall so you don't get knocked back out of the instance. Burn him down. Wait for Sanguinar, engage him about 30y inside from the raid door so you don't get feared out. Note the fear can be LOSed. Tank him where you killed Thaladred. Once he dies run back the way you came. Capernian will meet you just outside the doorway leading out of A'lar's room towards KT's room. AMS once you're within 30y of her and run past her, then run all the way back to the now-closed door leading into KT's room. With your back to this door, she -should- run into the previous doorway. Try and get her positioned so that you can stand between her and a wall and not be knocked back out of melee range. PVP trinket a conflagrate if necessary to do this. Burn her down. Telonicus is last, I took him just inside Void Reaver's room (which was empty since I'd killed him already) and killed him there. The first cast of Remote Toy -can- be LOSed here if you're lucky, so burn him quickly. Otherwise if you get the debuff, don't kill him until it has about 10 seconds left on it so that you're not being chain stunned at the start of...\n\n[b]Phase 2:[/b] Run back to where you killed Capernian. You'll meet the weapons halfway. Target and kill the Cosmic Infuser first. Interrupt its \"heal\" cast and drag it and the melee weapons on top of the bow/staff of Disintegration so you can AOE them down with D&D / pestilenced diseases / heart strike cleave. Once the Cosmic Infuser is dead, target the Phaseshift Bulwark and just heart strike cleave off of it until it's dead. Kill the rest. You should probably have 5-10 seconds left before...\n\n[b]Phase 3:[/b] The advisors resurrect. Stand between Capernian and the wall. I cast Army/Risen Ghoul at this point, AMSed just before she became targetable, blew cooldowns; Blood Fury, DRW etc. You [i]must[/i] kill Capernian as quickly as possible, preferrably before you get conflagged. If you do, PVP trinket. Telonicus will arrive when Capernian is at about 20-30%. Finish her off, then burn him. Don't IBF if you get Remote Toy, you can outheal the bomb damage, just run back and forth through him and most of his casts will miss. He should die just as Sanguinar arrives. Start burning Sanguinar and moving yourself slowly back towards the hallway connecting A'lar's room with Void Reaver's. Tank him with your back facing a wall. He should die just as Thaladred arrives, you will be knocked back the moment Thaladred gets within 20y of you and if you had your back to a wall this shouldn't be a problem. He should die with 10-15 seconds left before...\n\n[b]Phase 4:[/b] The moment Thaladred dies, run towards A'lar's room and be about 40-50y from the bottom of the ramp, between it and the doorway leading out of the instance. You may be able to bandage here. KT will cast his first Shock Barrier / Pyroblast somewhere on the ramp. AMS and run to him. AMS will absorb the first 1 1/2 Pyroblasts, interrupt the last one. Get diseases / D&D up, you will be disoriented at this point. The phoenix adds will kill themselves, so just cleave off of KT with heart strike. Try to avoid standing in the flamestrike AOE under where a phoenix spawns. Save PVP trinket for if your health gets low and you get disoriented. When the phoenix adds die and an egg spawns, switch to it and burn it as quickly as possible to avoid it rebirthing and knocking you back 40 yards. When KT is about to cast Shock Barrier again, AMS with a second or so to go, this will absorb the first Pyroblast and you should be able to burn through the shield to interrupt the next. Repeat until KT reaches 50% and transitions to phase 5.\n\nNote that KT does a mind control in Phase 4. KT -can- MC you, but only during the disorient and only if bloodworms or a ghoul are out during that time, and only if one of them resisted the disorient cast and gained aggro. I haven't been MCed yet over 3 solo kills and the ~20ish attempts I put in at first but you can simply spec out of worms if the risk bothers you.\n\n[b]Phase 5:[/b] KT will run all the way from where you are back to his room to do the RP / graphics that he does between these two phases. Note that [i]he is still attackable during this time while he is running[/i]. He runs a lot faster than you, so get diseases up and use Nitro Boosts to catch up to him to get more damage in if you can. If they fail no loss. You can get him down to 40% this way.\n\nKT will go through the RP. When he casts his first Gravity Lapse of the phase, he will teleport you to him (he will be just outside the door leading into his room) from wherever you are in the instance, and you'll have the flight buff. Refresh diseases, drop a D&D under him and start flying back to A'lar's room, don't bother AMSing or worrying about the damage he does midair. Try not to land before the debuff falls off. If the debuff falls off while you're at a great height, parachute cloak or Path of Frost to negate fall damage. Get back down the ramp to where you started Phase 4, you can bandage here. Strangulate the first fireball cast, AMS and tank him at the bottom of the ramp, burn him as much as possible before the next Gravity Lapse. When he does Gravity Lapse fly away from him, drop a D&D under him and any adds and refresh diseases on him. Wait for Gravity Lapse to end before reengaging in melee. The only thing that can really kill you in this phase is Flamestrike, which can hit for 80K or so. If you're disoriented and see the flamestrike animation appearing under you, PVP trinket, otherwise you should be fine.\n\nCollect your free gold, loot and hopefully phoenix mount.\n\ned: Sound no longer bugs out.", "date": "2011-02-12T11:08:11-06:00", "rating": 54, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I had a few differences in my experiences.

We tried it without the staff a couple of times, but the fearing etc... was annoying, and cutting into dps.

Once at Kael, the RNG becomes the largest factor. Kael can MC 2-3 people. For us, it seemed to always be three. If he MC'd three, I'd have to bubble, and then use other tricks to stay alive. Our best attempts came when I had resistance aura up, and Kael only MC'd one person (since he's supposed to do 2-3, I'm guessing the others resisted - not sure if the fact I had resistence aura up or not helped - it might have been purely co-incidental. I just know for future attempts, I'll have it up!).\r\n\r\nOn our successful attempt, he only MC'd once and chose the mage who just blocked it off. We did not have a Pheonix spawn.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 134, "id": 1361857, "nreplies": 7, "sticky": 0, "user": "Mecha", "body": "[b]Two-manned[/b] him this evening as a [b]Ret Paladin and a Boomkin[/b] using modified strategies found in these comments (thanks guys.) \r\n\r\nFirst off, I cleared the whole instance beforehand for gold so there wasn't any trash up.  The strategy took a few tries to perfect, but it's fairly easy once you get the hang of it.  I'll try to describe it the best I can while being brief.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Phase 1[/u][/b]\r\nStart the encounter and immediately run to the instance portal.  Wait for Thaladred to make his appearance several minutes later and take him out.  The second boss will begin making his way to you - stay where you are and kill him once he gets to you.\r\n\r\nOnce he dies, immediately start running back towards Kael's room via the Voidreaver side of the instance.  You'll run into the caster boss at the top of the ramp in A'lar's room.  I just judged her and we ran right past.  Take the ramp back up to Kael's room as far as you can go (the door into his room will be sealed since the encounter has started) and LoS her as best as you can into the little ante-chamber, then kill her (I had my back to a wall so the knockback wouldn't throw me out of melee range).\r\n\r\nOnce she dies, immediately start running to Voidreaver's room and the last boss (the engineer) will be close behind.  We took him to the far back wall to give us as much time as possible later.  Once positioned, take him out - if anyone gets remote toy, wait until it has about 10-15 seconds left before killing him since it can proc at really annoying times.  Once he dies, immediately start running back towards Kael's room.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Phase 2[/u][/b]\r\nOn your way back towards Kael's room (where you killed the ranged boss) you'll run into the weapons.  Like previous comments said, I targeted the cosmic infuser first and interrupted it whenever it started to cast a heal.  I made sure I had aggro on everything and my Boomkin friend went nuts with the AE.\r\n\r\nThe boomkin picked up the staff and equiped it, making sure to use it so we had the buff.  We ran back up to where we killed the ranged boss and nuked her down again as soon as she spawned.  Right as we finished, the engineer from Voidreaver's room showed up and we took him out.  Shortly after, the second boss we killed next to Thaladred showed up and we nuked him down easily.\r\n\r\nOnce those three were dead, we went back into A'lar's room.  We met Thaladred and finished him off.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Phase 3[/u][/b]\r\nI positioned myself at the mouth of the door that connect's A'lar's room to the hallway that leads to Voidreaver.  The boomkin sat to my left, out of LoS from the hall.  Kael will eventually make his way down and I tanked him in that exact spot - as long as the boomkin stayed out of LoS, he would not get mind controlled.  [b]Interrupt as many fireballs as you can.[/b]  Occasionally you'll see Kael yell something that signals he attempted to use a mind control.  Afterwards, the druid would pop out to DPS some or grab a phoenix off me.  We also made sure to kill the phoenix egg each time so we wouldn't get overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nWhen Kael puts up shock barrier, I just pop Divine Protection since I'll be eating the first pyro blast, but his shield can easily be taken down in time to interrupt the second.  Using 3 holy power to heal myself usually, we widdled him down to 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Phase 4[/u][/b]\r\nKael will start running back towards his room.  You can follow and DPS him during this time without any threat.  Once he makes it all the way back to his room, he'll do some RP crap while you sit around twiddling your thumbs.  Eventually he'll port you to just outside his room and cast gravity lapse on you.  At this point it seemed like he stopped casting Mind Control so when he came back out we just nuked him down.  \r\n\r\n300g, some epic junk and no mount.  But with only needing 2 people, it shouldn't be hard to farm this guy weekly.  I hope this helps anyone willing to try - it was late when I wrote this and I'm pretty tired, so I apologize for any redundancy and the fact this looks like it was written by a 12 year old, lol.\r\n\r\nThanks to previous posters for the suggestions on how to solo this guy.

This is how we did it, and a slightly different strat for level 80's in a smaller raid.\r\n\r\nRaid comp:\r\n2 tanks (preferably 1 prot warr at least)\r\n2 full time heals\r\n1 offheals (moonkin / ele shammy)\r\n4 ranged dps\r\nOur gear level was approx. full T7 / mostly T7.5. Able to down 3 drake Sartharion with all the dpsers. You may need to bring additional dpsers if yours aren't that geared, however when new content patches come out, this won't be as much of a concern.\r\nWe wiped a few times trying to 8 man the fight without an elemental shaman, but we brought him in and the random spot chain heals and the heroism/bloodlust helped a ton in phase 4. Having 2 healers is preferred because one healer might have to move, accidentally die, or some other unforseen event. The actual damage going around the raid is trivial, and we had 1 healer healing phase 4 for some time before a mind controlled player feared him.\r\n\r\nI recommend using a prot warr for phase 4 because they are extremely mobile for phase 4, and can easily dispel MC's without accidentally killing someone. Most players can easily take several devastates without it being a serious issue. Any tank can now MT Kael now though, the pyroblast was a joke and no cooldowns were needed to survive being hit.\r\nPhase 1: Introduction\r\nNot much to this phase, none of the mobs hit particularly hard and they all dropped extremely quickly. For Thaldred, the melee were able to walk up to him and start dpsing without any care if he turned around and started attacking them.\r\nActually positioning the mobs so they are in good places for phase 3 was also not much of a concern for us. We did attempt to have Capernian positioned on the right side of the room, and everything else on the left side, but with the speed of the dps it was not entirely successful.\r\nPhase 2: Legendary Weapons\r\nWe had enough dps to completely destroy the weapons with about 10 seconds to spare before phase 3 started. I would recommend keeping the prot warr on the Cosmic Infuser, as it does heal itself frequently. Shield Bashes, Concussion Blows, Shockwaves are all needed to stop it from healing while all the weapons are being aoe'd down. Also, having him pick up the Staff of Disintegration early on, silence it, and drag it into the aoe helps a lot. The staff likes to stay in it's current spot and just cast at people unless someone does somethin about it.\r\n\r\nWe had a paladin tank to pick up all the other weapons (cept the bow, which was still done by a hunter). We even left the Devastation in there with the rest of the weapon as nothing there really hit for much.\r\n\r\nDO NOT FORGET TO EQUIP THE WEAPONS. We did have some fresh people on the run who didn't understand that the weapons became lootable when they died, and required being looted and equipped. Not having enough casters with the staff in the raid will make or break the fight still. Phase 3 is serious still.\r\n\r\nIf you have a good number of single target dps in the raid, this is the dps order for the weapons I would recommend:\r\nStaff of Disintegration -> Cosmic Infuser -> Infinity Blade -> Phaseshift Bulwark -> Warp Slicer.\r\nFor us, the bow died somewhere in the mix with the hunter nuking it down and the aoe hitting it. We never really had to worry about having to dps it at all.\r\nPhase 3: Advisors\r\nIf you do not have most to all of the weapons down at this point, then it will likely be a wipe and you need more dps. \r\n\r\nWe were forced to change the dps order of the Advisors because of the annoyance of their abilities to a 9 man raid. Capernian was a serious threat to the raid because she would chain-conflag someone (often a tank, occasionally a heals or unlucky dps). There isn't always a staff that is going to be near in a raid that small so we nuked her first, while keeping an eye on thaldred and kiting him around as needed. If he did aggro to someone important, a bop works wonders for keeping them alive. \r\n\r\nKilling Capernian is going the be the tough part of phase 3, her abilities severely restrict movement and make the whole phase rather annoying to deal with till she is dead. We didn't have to burn our heroism to down her, but if your raid is having trouble that is a good option. \r\nNext up is Thaldred, just as much of a joke in phase 3 as phase 1, it took us a little bit longer to down him though.\r\nEither Sanguinar or Telonicus will work next, neither is a very serious concern. We even had an add still up beating on the MT going into phase 4.\r\nPhase 4: Taking matters into one's own hands\r\nThis was a bit chaotic for us the first few tries, but we eventually got the hang of it. At least 2 people should have a set of the daggers to dispel the Mind Control with. The prot warrior was the primary person to dispel the MC's for us, because of the mobility the Warbringer talent gives, and 30 yard taunts bring players over rather easily. A backup is needed in case the warrior does get MC'd himself though. \r\nFear should be avoided on MC'd people unless the person dispelling them got it also. It is very hard to chase down a player and attack them if they are running around randomly. \r\n\r\nFor the Phoenix adds, we had the prot warrior also tank those at the same time as dispelling Mind Controls. The Phoenixes are still level 70, and their aoe is of little concern as it nearly always misses. DPS should still nuke it down and then the egg it leaves behind though, eventually they will become a dangerous nuisance if you let them multiply and wander around randomly. \r\n\r\nDo not forget to move out of the Flame Strikes! Those hurt a lot a 70, and they will hurt a lot at 80. \r\n\r\nYou can have any tank on the boss really, Pyroblast hits for 20-25k, which is less than our tanks had unbuffed. It is still nice to interrupt it as you get the chance, and use the shield to absorb the first one.\r\n\r\nHeroism / Bloodlust should be saved for 80% here, give a good amount of time to make sure all the advisors or down, everyone is in a good spot and is comfortable.\r\nPhase 5: True Power (lol)\r\nThe fight is won at this point, this phase is a joke at 80, especially with a 9 man raid. When he does Gravity Lapse, everyone should spread out a little bit as to not be right next to each other. Also don't go too high up in the air as when the debuff runs out, you will fall to the ground and take fall damage. The actual raid damage is next to nothing in the air, so nobody should be dying at this point.\r\nPhoenixes will continue to spawn in this phase, and should still be killed until boss reaches 15% (ish). After that is is safe to straight up nuke Kael and go for the loots, only worrying about the adds afterwards.\r\n1 minor thing to note about Heroism / Bloodlust, it is a risk using it in phase 4 as he can mind control your shaman and buff himself with it. He wont be much more of a threat, but you lose out on your heroism. If you are worried about this happening then burn it in phase 3 right at the start. \r\n\r\nGood luck and happy hunting for the Ashes!\"", "date": "2011-03-23T01:10:08-05:00", "rating": -4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Old.

Using similar tactics to others, but I'll stick them here as we found this worked best for us:\r\n\r\n1. Cleared all trash and first phoenix boss in the instance. I did all of this as Fury with heroic quality gear. Clear everything between the entrance and Kael'thas.\r\n\r\n2. Switched back to a Protection Spec in DPS gear. Ate mastery food and used a Prismatic Elixir to reduce my magic damage. Engaged Kael'thas (run near him) and then move all the way back to the instance entrance and wait.\r\n\r\n3. Kill the first two NPCs by the door. Don't stand too close as one does a knock-back and the other fears. Getting thrown out of the instance is bad this way!\r\n\r\n4. Once the first two mobs are dead, run back to Kael'thas. You will engage the fire lady half-way, aggro her but keep moving back to Kael'thas. The door will be locked, but kill her as close to it as possible. She's a pain.\r\n\r\n5. Kill the next NPC around the same place.\r\n\r\n6. Line of site the weapons by standing to the side of the door by Kael'thas (still locked). Mark up and use this kill order:\r\n   - Cosmic Infuser (interrupt the heals too)\r\n   - Staff of Disintegration\r\n   - Phaseshift Bulwark (I took this third as it's the hardest to kill from incidental AoE).\r\n\r\nWhilst killing all these, use cleave and other AoE moves liberally to get them all down fast.\r\n\r\n[b]Important:[/b] Someone needs to loot and equip the Staff of Disintegration. This is key to winning this fight. Once equipped, they need to activate it's use function. You now cannot be affected by Conflagration or Remote Toy.\r\n\r\n7. Once the weapons are all dead, the original NPCs will engage. Single target nuke Grand Astromancer Capernian (the lady). She does a knock-back which bugs often teleporting you to the entrance of the instance. To avoid this, never have your back to a wall.\r\n\r\n8. Nuke the remaining NPCs in the same kind of area as they appear. You shouldn't have any problems with the remainder. Once the last mob is dead, run back to the large room in which Al'ar was killed.\r\n\r\n9. Kael'thas will run towards you. Tank him in the doorway. It's critical that your healer line of site him at all times. We did this by having me stand in the doorway and Kael'thas to the left of it. The healer stood further down the corridor. Other variations will work just as well, but it's critical that he never gets to mind control the other player - it's probably game over if that happens.\r\n\r\n10. Nuke him down, using cleave and other AoE abilities to take out eggs and Phoenixes. Don't stand in the fire and just endure this phase. It takes a while.\r\n\r\n11. At 50% he will run back to where you pulled him. Run back with him and wait by the door (it's still locked ofc :)). This is a good time to hymn of hope if mana is a problem.\r\n\r\n12. Once he comes back, he will do a gravity lapse on you. Just move away and use any ranged abilities you have. A Disc Priest with an Archangel Build is useful here. Don't engage him whilst he's casting Nether Beam - which he may do so just after the gravity phase completes.\r\n\r\n13. Tank and spank him this way, moving away during gravity lapse. As in phase 4, AoE the Phoenix and eggs with cleave and other AoE moves. Depending on your luck/dps, the staff may expire from your healer. It won't make much of a difference except you'll get CCd a bit more. Remember to re-equip your proper weapon if it does happen...\r\n\r\nHope this helps. We've got this place on easy mode farm now for the mount. The whole boss fight can last upwards of 15 minutes and a full clear of trash and Al'ar about 20-30... so come prepared to spend a bit of time here whilst you master the phases.\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2011-03-26T17:27:28-05:00", "rating": 7, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

We let [npc=20060] run to us midway and killed him on the spot. Then [npc=20062] was where it got \"fun\"\r\n\r\nWe found it best to position [npc=20062] between Kael's statue on the right side of the room. We kept running around until the mob was in between the statue and the wall. (This becomes very important for phase 3)\r\n\r\nFinally [npc=20063] came into play and the only thing we focused on was his toy buff. We brought his health down until 10k hp then we waited for the toy buff to hit 20 seconds on the last person then killed him.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Kill order: Staff (had druid equip and buff asap), Slicer (to stop the bleed debuff), Cosmo (heals weapons), Then the rest in w/e order they come by. When Phase 3 came close to beginning we made sure we were positioned where we placed [npc=20062]. Then we killed off what we could before the adds popped.\r\n\r\n**Sidenote** If the advisors pop before you down the rest of the weapons focus on the mage and kill her with everything you got\r\n\r\nPhase 3: We focused on killing the mage first, make sure you have the staff buff on or everything goes to hell. Once Thal finally made his way toward us we started kiting him around the room avoiding his damage and bleed effect. Killed the other two as we kited burning small CDs and watched for Phase 4.\r\n\r\nPhase 4: Very important that the healer runs like hell when Kael engages if you are not on his platform to get aggro. We found getting Kael where the mage was placed was our best shot. Once in position we had the healer LoS on the other side of the statue making her immune to MC. Avoid the flame circles, kill the adds and eggs asap, then focus on Kael. The adds are your main focus once they are down take down the eggs. \r\n\r\nPhase 5: He runs away and goes back to his platform and its pretty much cake. Fly around once you engage him again and punch his lights out. \r\n\r\nBoth toons had an avg ilvl of 348\r\n\r\nAs I stated above we tried several methods until we found one which worked with our style. Phase 3 is the toughest part of the match. Phase 4 was rough b/c MC kept catching me (Fury warrior) off guard and I'd murder the healer. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking to farm Kael find the method which works for you and make sure you have the time and effort to put into figuring out the right fit. \r\n\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2011-04-06T00:39:21-05:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Was really simple when we got our tactics sorted. The main issues we encountered were 1) the staff and mace going a seperate way from the other weapons and pulling trash we hadn't cleared 2) issues killing weapons on time (which was sorted by just popping all cooldowns, including BL on the weapons 3) a slight panic on my behalf in phase 5 with the nether beams. \r\n\r\nWe used the positioning tactic of getting Thaladred/Sanguinar down to and killed at entrance, move up to outside Kael's room for Capernian, back to A'lar's room for Telonicus, and killed the weapons beside Capernian's corpse. Priest would equip and use the staff, essentially trivialising P3.\r\n\r\nMCs were a non-issue. Initially we tried a tactic where I tanked Kael in the doorway to Alar's room, while my priest would stand so he could reach me but was LoSing MC, however, Flamestrikes plus phoenix death knockbacks meant I had to move position too much. I found with self heals and interrupting every single Fireball,  I could take him fine on my own, so the priest would just stand far out of LoS from both of us, and when Kael shouted out a cue he had attempted to Mind Control (\"Obey me!\") the priest would move into LoS, heal me up, shield, etc, then after 20 secs or so move away again. With this tactic we had 0 mind controls, as the 'main tank' is not targetted by them.\r\n\r\nWe were also never really sure what to do with the Phoenixes/Eggs but I sort of took to just killing them when they were close.

[b]Thaladred [/b]is first. He moves slowly, knocks his target back periodically, and applies a bleed at melee range. Your goal is to kill him as far away from the other members as possible. Set your non-tank pet to passive to make sure he keeps following you. When he reaches the back of the room, kill him and run to the front.\n\nNext is [b]Sanguinar[/b]. He merely casts a 35-yard radius fear. He will cast fear a few seconds after he spawns, which you should counter immediately with Bestial Wrath. Try to position him inside one of the two purple circles near the stairs as he is about to die.\n\nThird is [b]Capernian[/b], who chucks fireballs, casts an AoE knockback that slows, and a short-range disorient. Again, try to position her near the circle before killing her. Make sure you stay in range of her attacks, so that if your pet gets disoriented she doesn't need to move to reach you.\n\nThe final advisor in this phase is [b]Telonicus[/b], who essentially casts a debuff called Remote Toy that causes its victim to be stunned for 3 seconds at random intervals for a minute. He will use this ability [i]exactly [/i]after [u]two[/u] or [u]three[/u] Bomb casts. Position him in the same circle as before, and half a second after he casts his second Bomb, hit Deterrence, and do not remove it. It should last until just after his third bomb is cast, making sure that Remote Toy [b]cannot [/b]affect you. As he is about to die, move onto the platform, and place an Explosive Trap at the top of the stairs. Kill Telonicus, and immediately dismiss your pet, summoning your tank pet as soon as you can thereafter.\n\n[b]Phase 2[/b]\nIdeally, the latter three advisors will be piled up in the aforementioned circle at this point. Several weapons will spawn to attack you as soon as Telonicus is killed. Make sure Misdirection is on your pet, and let the trap tick a few times. [b][u]Do not cast Multi-Shot[/u][/b]!. This will only cause aggro issues later in the phase, and you want to kill the weapons one by one, not via AoE. When Misdirection fades, recast it. \n\nYour first target is Staff of Disintegration. Cast Bestial Wrath and destroy it quickly. [u][b]Loot the staff, equip it and use it immediately[/b][/u]. If you don't loot within a few minutes of its death, it will disappear. It's easy to forget, so make sure you get it immediately!\n\nOnce you've done this, proceed to to attack Netherstrand Longbow. Cosmic Infuser is your next target, kill it using Rapid Fire and try to prevent it from healing with Intimidation.\n\nWarp Slicer is the last priority target to kill, as it stacks a painful bleed debuff on your pet. Once it's dead, finish off the other two weapons in any order, and leave the shield for last. If you don't manage to destroy Phaseshift Bulwark before the next phase begins, don't worry, it isn't very menacing. \n\nDuring this phase, use Cower and Shell Shield / Harden Carapace as much as you can during Rapid Fire and Bestial Wrath. Use Mend Pet sparingly, as damage is key in this phase.\n\n[b]Phase 3[/b]\nKael will yell a long speech before the third phase begins, which lets you know you should plant an Explosive Trap on the circle where the three advisors' corpses lie. Cast misdirection and a few Mult-Shots as soon as the advisors respawn. \n\n[b]Remember to stay near your pet during this phase, or the buff from the staff you looted (which prevents disorients and stuns) will fade. [/b]\n\nAs in phase 1, you will get feared early on, which you will counter with Bestial Wrath. Nuke the $%^& out of Capernian - try to kill her before Thaladred reaches you. Your pet will take more damage now than in phase 2, so be sure to keep an eye on its health. \n\n[b]If you are standing near any one of the room's walls, Thaladred's knocback may cause you to fly beyond one of those walls, which will cause him to teleport you right next to him. To prevent this, Disengage in the opposite direction when you get knocked back and feel you would fly past a wall. [/b]\n\nThaladred is vaguely tankable, but he doesn't have a regular threat table and may change targets frequently. He is also the hardest-hitting of the advisors, so keep the heals coming. Use any remaining cooldowns to take him down.\n\nSanguinar's fear gets pretty annoying, and in the DPS race that is Phase 3 (though less intensive than phase 2 if executed correctly), it matters. Smoke him promptly.\n\nWhen Telonicus is the last living council member and has little health left, move him, along with your pet, to the little alcove formed by the right Kael'thas statue and the nearby wall. Make sure your pet is behind the statue (this can be a hassle sometimes, be patient). Place an Immolation at the mouth of the alcove, and finish Telonicus off. \n\n[b]Phase 4[/b]\nKael'thas will run towards you the instant you kill the last advisor. Don't try to attack him to misdirect threat, as he will probably stop and cast spells at a range. Simply allow him to walk into your trap, and move off to the other side of the statue. He will now begin attacking your pet.\n\nKael'thas casts Mind Control during this phase. Your pet is immune to this spell, but you are not, which is why you must stay out of Kael's line of sight. However, Mind Control has a [b]30 second cooldown[/b], so type /sw at the start of the phase, and start it as soon as he casts it. You now know how much time you have before he is able to recast it. The emotes he issues when he casts it are [b]\"Obey me!\"[/b] and [b]\"Bow to my will!\"[/b].\n\nKael will periodically spawn a phoenix, which will run straight to you if your pet has Mend Pet on it. Kill it and its egg as soon as you can each time it spawns. Feign Death [b]can cause it to despawn[/b] - use this to your advantage.\n\nWhen Kael begins to cast Pyroblast, you know you have 3 casts before which he [b]will not cast Mind Control[/b], so make sure you heal your pet up during this sequence.\n\nSometimes, you will be out of range of your pet, and the staff buff will fade from it. This will cause Kael to disorient it, and run towards you. Quickly [b]Feign Death[/b] and let him run back to your pet. \n\nUse Kill Command to deal damage from behind the statue, and make good use of your pet's cooldowns to mitigate Fireball damage.\n\n[b]Phase 5[/b]\nAt 50%, Kael runs to the middle of the room. The main addition in this phase is Gravity Lapse, which shuttles you into the air if you touch the ground. If you are high up and see the debuff fading, [b]Disengage before landing[/b] to avoid fall damage. No more Mind Control, though!\n\n[b]Keep your pet away from the boss while affected by Gravity Lapse[/b] to prevent it from suffering too many Nether Vapor (reduces health) stacks. Kill the phoenixes, and finally, Kael'thas himself.\n\nHappy looting!", "date": "2011-09-01T06:32:16-05:00", "rating": 25, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "It should be well noted that there is a pseudo-timer on P3.

However, since it has only 46k hp, you can burn it down fast.\r\nAlso, you can cast Kill Command trough that wall (the other way round did not work for me...)\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of standing here, is that you are immediately well positioned when phase 5 starts..\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents...", "date": "2011-10-13T06:53:30-05:00", "rating": 18, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 165, "id": 1563277, "nreplies": 2, "sticky": 0, "user": "215749", "body": "Managed to solo this on my ret paladin. I would recommend firelands gear, though I still have a few 359s and the troll heroic shoulders. Here's how I did it (using the modified dk solo strat posted earlier on, so use that for reference if you need to see areas to run on the map):\n\nBandages are useful because you won't always have enough mana to heal yourself fully when there's some downtime. A pvp trinket or human racial is a must for the encounter. I would also recommend flask and food buffs. I use a typical ret pve spec/glyphs, though I don't have eye for an eye which may help in this encounter. I brought along some healing and strength pots in case I needed them, but I did not end up using either. Use Resistance Aura whenever Capernian or Kael is engaged, and Ret Aura otherwise.\n\n[u][b]Phase 1[/b][/u]\nStart the encounter and run all the way back to the main entrance. Kill Thaladred and Sanguinar as close to the entrance as possible, but make sure not to get knocked out of the instance. I used Seal of Vengeance on Thaladred, then healed up from his rend while waiting for Sanguinar. I used Seal of Light on Sanguinar, and made sure I was at full health and 3 holy power when he died.\n\nAfter Sanguinar dies, run all the way back to the gated door at the entrance to Kael's room. Capernian will attack you on the way there, use Divine Protection right as she's tossing conflag for the first time as you're running back to Kael's room. After the conflag use some sort of speed boost (rocket boots, swiftness pot, judgement) and run past her, continuing until you reach Kael's door. Once Capernian follows you and is inside the small hallway, trinket out of the conflag and kill her. After she's dead run to the small hallway before Void Reaver's room and quickly heal up while waiting for Telonicus. Kill Telonicus once he arrives there, preferably waiting until remote toy has 30 seconds or less left (or if you get really lucky, you resist it :P).\n\n[u][b]Phase 2[/b][/u]\nThis is one of the easier phases. In the middle of the large hall between Al'ar and Void Reaver rooms, you'll want to stand near the 3 way intersection in the middle of the hall, but stay out of LoS of the section of the hall leading up to Kael. After you get in position, you have a few seconds to heal up before the weapons reach you, and remote toy should fall off during this time. Also switch to Seal of Righteousness during this time. Take out the Warp Slicer first, as it leaves a nasty rend that hurts almost as much as Thaladred's once it get stacked up. After that, kill the cosmic infuser while interrupting its heals. While killing these two I just subbed in divine storm for crusader strike so that the other weapons got reasonably damaged as well. Pick off the rest of the weapons in whatever order, ensuring that you will have 3 holy power when the last one dies. When you have one left, keep it up, heal yourself, and head over to where you killed Capernian. At this point if Kael hasn't engaged phase 3 yet (it usually happens right when I finish running to Capernian for me), you have maybe 10 seconds before he will, so just finish off the last weapon and switch to Seal of Vengeance.\n\n[u][b]Phase 3[/b][/u]\nYou should be in position to attack Capernian, make sure your back is against the wall. Hit all cooldowns at this point, and trinket the first conflag. With all cooldowns used, you should be able to kill her before the second conflag and before Telonicus reaches you. Switch to Seal of Light after Capernian dies. You should be able to take a good chunk of health out of Telonicus while your cooldowns are still up, and finish him off just before Sanguinar reaches you. Kill Sanguinar, and then Thaladred, taking care to not get overwhelmed by rend damage. After thaladred is dead, go back into the area where you LoSed the weapons and heal up.\n\n[u][b]Phase 4[/b][/u]\nKael will run over to your LoS spot slowly, and you should have plenty of time to heal up. In addition, he'll use his first disorient on his way running to you, and it will fade right as he reaches you. Hit your cooldowns (they should just be up again) and commence nuking Kael (still have seal of light up). Interrupt the fireballs when you can, and trinket the disorient when possible.He uses his first waves of Pyroblasts with his second disorient, so make sure that your trinket is available for that one. I ignored the phoenixes until they killed themselves, and then just killed the eggs. Continue until 50%, and then phase 5 starts. Heal yourself up and then run to the small hallway before Kael's gated door.\n\nThis phase can be more difficult than phase 3, as Kael's fireballs and Pyroblasts (if he manages to get any off) hit really hard. Just make sure to save your trinket for the second disorient so you can interrupt the first set of Pyroblasts before they hit you. I saved divine shield for the second set of Pyroblasts, and did not encounter a third set. Also make sure to interrupt the fireballs, as they hit for a decent 20k\n\n[u][b]Phase 5[/b][/u]\nExtremely easy phase. He will initially cast gravity lapse, all you have to do is stand away from him until he's done and the nether vapors disappear. Then hit your cooldowns and nuke him, trinketing the disorient. Make sure to interrupt fireballs. You'll likely have to go through 2 gravity lapses before Kael dies.\n\nI did not need to use Lay on Hands during the encounter at all, but if it looks like you might need it the best time to use it is probably in phase 3, since you'll want forbearance to be gone by phase 4 in case you get stuck in a disorient with trinket down and he starts casting Pyros.

When you see him casting its [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=36834]Arcane Disruption[/url] (it looks like Mage's Arcane Explosion), equip the mace and cast 3 Lifeblooms, then re-equip the staff.

In addition, make distance with the boss: at the first Pyroblast, just go to the Al'ar room. For the followings, use the stairs and the space to be far away at the end of the Pyroblast. Don't forget to put 3 Lifeblooms with the mace and re-activate the staff before returning on the boss.[/li]\n[li]The mana : if you get oom, just run away until your innervate is up.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nAn important note is that the weapons disappear after 15 minutes so don't be too long because you will die very quickly when you lose them.\n\nWhen Kael'Thas life is below 50%, he will run to its room. You will have between 1 and 2 minutes before the fight starts again so use this time to kill all the phoenix and the eggs.\nAlso, make sure you are at the [b]LEFT[/b] side of the room, otherwise Kael'Thas will summon you in the middle of trashes (...)\nHeals yourself with your normal weapon and wait for the teleport.\n\n[ul]\n[li][b][u]Phase five: Kael\u2019Thas and his gravity lapse[/u][/b][/li]\n[/ul]\n\nHe doesn't use mind control at this point so your treants can be used.\n\nWhen his [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=35941]Gravity Lapse[/url] is in action, run away from the boss, kill any phoenix/egg. Six seconds before the end of the gravity lapse, put three Lifeblooms with the mace and activate the staff.\n\nJust like phase 4 : don't kill Phoenix/eggs unless you are in the air. Heal yourself after the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=36834]Arcane Disruption[/url]. If your weapons don't disappear, this phase is really easy.\n\nAfter that, pray and loot :-) (got it at my third attempt ^^)", "date": "2011-11-27T11:36:05-06:00", "rating": 26, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-11-27T11:45:22-06:00", 9, "Source"]}

Clear a path of trash (though I cleared the entire raid of bosses/trash prior to my wife coming) \r\n\r\nPhase 1: Warlock waits by the raid entrance. I go and initiate the encounter and run back to the entrance and wait for thaladred there. Kill thaladred and rinse/repeat with sanguinar. Then I pop stampeding roar and we run up back towards kael and meet the grand astromancer on the way. We kite her to the bottom of the ramp leading to kael's room and kill her there. Then we take the engineer to the wall of  lootreaver's room. When he's dead...\r\n\r\nPhase 2: We run back towards Kael's room and meet the weapons at the bottom of the ramp where we killed the astromancer. LoS them so they all group up. Kill the cosmic infuser first and then pop berserk and kill the rest pretty quickly. My wife takes the staff and puts the buff on us. \r\n\r\nPhase 3: We kill the astromancer quickly just in time for the engineer to pop up by the time he's about to die, sanguinar pops up and we kill him and then go meet thaladred by the doorway that separates al'ars room from the corridor and kill him there.\r\n\r\nPhase 4: We wait for Kael to come, my wife pops out a felhunter to help with the interrupts and stay's LoS untitl the mind-control shizzle is done and then pops out ocassionally to help dps the phoenix egg and get the barrier down to interrupt the pyro's. Basically it entails mashing buttons and screaming at my wife \"comeeee onnn\" until we make it. Frantically press heals and prepare for Phase 5\r\n\r\nPhase 5: We expected to get teleported inside Kael's room, so we were quite surprised when he teleported to the corridor (not really giving us much space to avoid his clouds...)

I used the +spirit pvp trinket and two pieces of the Shadow 397 Dragon Soul set.)\r\n\r\nSpec & Glyphs: http://www.wowhead.com/talent#bfRsMRsbcorZMubZM:mMkaVdzM0 \r\n\r\nI used a +300 int flask and +90 int food.  After all four adds were down I canceled the flask and switched to a prismatic elixir (+90 resistance) and Elixir of the Cobra (+225 crit).  I also used a Deathblood venom potion in phase 2 against the legendary weapons.\r\n\r\nPre-battle: Kill everything else in the instance.  You'll be zooming all over the instance kiting.  The last thing you need are unwanted adds.  You'll need help to kill Void Reaver as he cannot be solo'ed by a priest.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 -- Kill the first three advisers at the start of the instance.  Kill Telonicus on the ramp in A'lar's room.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 -- Fight at an intersection leading to Kael's room.  Open with Holy Fire and Pain on the shield.  Pop Shadowfiend, Fade, Power Infusion, and nuke down the shield.  The instant it dies, siwtch to the mace and kill it.\r\n\r\nOnce the mace dies, gather all weapons together (casting Pain on them as you do so) just around sight from the hallway to Al'ar's room, pop a deathblood venom, and repeatedly cast Mind Sear.  It's critical you do as much damage as possible before the advisers arrive in phase 3.   (Suriving weapons also gain additional health when phase 3 starts).  \r\n\r\nNote that all weapons are immune to Devouring Plague.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 -- Continue AoE'ing for about ten seconds after the advisors repop.  Finish off the Staff of Disintegration with direct dps, grab the staff, equip it, and keep mind searing for another 1-2 casts.  Then switch to Warp Slicer and direct DPS it down.  You'll likely need both Pain Suppression and Desperate Prayer as the Rend debuff has stacked quite high by now.\r\n\r\nMove back into the hallway and Pain several targets, most notably the daggers (which are low on health by now) and the axe (which is at moderate health).  Smite the daggers and/or axe until the next two advisers.  They'll start hurting you so place yourself in the hallway such that Thaladred's knockback will send you flying once he arrives. You'll be relying on Thaladred to keep knocking you back out of enemy melee range.  (Hint: use levitate when knocked back to gain additional distance.)\r\n\r\nKill order for the rest of the fight is:  Daggers > Axe > Sanguinus > Telonicus > Carpernian > Thaladred > Bow > Kael > Phoenixes. \r\n\r\nMelee weapons die first because they're low on health and have high dps.  Sanguinus dies next because his fear is highly annoying and his dps is high.  Telonicus has the next highest dps, followed by Carpernian.  Once all those are down there isn't much need for Thaladred's knockback so he can be killed.  The bow primarily does AoE damage and not much of it, so just toss a pain on it whenever you happened to tab across it.  It'll die in due course.\r\n\r\nPhase 4:  Kael joins in about the time the first advisor is going down.  (Or second if you got lucky and Telonicus's first Remote Toy attack missed, thus allowing you to use your high spellpower weapons for an additional 15 seconds.)\r\n\r\nKite the advisors back and forth between Al'ar's room (spending as much time as you can running in a circle on the ledge there), blowing cooldowns anytime you start taking significant damage from the advisers, phoenixes, and Kael'thas.  \r\n\r\nOnce the advisers and weapons are down, switch back to your normal weapons.  Start DOT'ing Kael'thas and keep running away.  His 10-second disorient only hurts if you've got a mess of phoenixes on you, so blow a cooldown (pvp trinket, Pain Suppression, or Desperate Prayer) if you get CC'ed when they're close.  Kael runs fast though, so it doesn't hurt to keep running way ahead using Inner Will.  He will catch up and you can DOT him then.\r\n\r\nOnce you've had your weapons re-equipped for a while you'll have plenty of mana, so feel free to refresh DOTs even when they're only halfway through their duration.  And keep yourself constantly Shielded, Renewed, and Prayer of Mending-ed.\r\n\r\nOne final note: If you cast Shadowfiend in phase 4, you risk being mind controlled and the encounter resetting.  Kael does not mind control his tank.  So you can be mind controlled if: A) you cast shadowfiend then fade, or B) You cast shadowfiend, Kael'thas casts his disorient ability, and the shadowfiend resists the disorient while you do not.\r\n\r\nPhase 5: Kael'thas will run back to his room at 50%.  Just keep kiting the phoenixes.  You could single-target down a few if you're bored, but they're even easier to kite in phase 5 (when you're flying) than in phase 4.  \r\n\r\nOtherwise, just keep him DOT'ed, stay way ahead of the phoenixes, and toss a few smites on Kael when opportunity presents itself.

Full heroic Firelands gear or normal DS gear. Legendary staff is nice but not necessary but you should have a good weapon regardless. Kings drums, fort scroll, int flask and food buff.\n\nSpec arcane, standard 31/33 / 7/5 / 3 arcane PVE spec is fine. Take 3/3 Prismatic Cloak. 2/2 Imp Blink or 2/3 Fire Power is the only choice here. I did it with 2/3 Fire Power because I was too lazy to respec and my mage is worgen with sprint racial, but 2/2 Imp Blink is preferable. This fight may be doable as fire, but I doubt it as you won't have the raw burst that arcane has and Incanter's Absorption is ludicrously OP here.\n\nUse Mage Armor at all times.\n\nPhase 1: Kite Thaladred and Sanguinar to the instance entrance, kill them there. Use mana shield liberally. Kill Capernian about halfway between the entrance and the door to KT's room. If you are at absolute max range, she will probably not conflag you. Kill Telonicus towards the bottom of the ramp leading to the door to KT's room.\n\nPhase 2: Focus down Devastation first. Drop a ring of frost as the weapons are approaching, they will all be frozen and you can kill Devastation and possibly the Phaseshift Bulwark here. Pop images and kill the rest asap. Phaseshift Bulwark's pummel ability is an [b]8 second[/b] lockout so don't let it be in melee range of you without images up. Bandage, loot, equip and /use the Staff of Disintegration.\n\nPhase 3: Blow Telonicus up, use AP/Mana Gem early here. If he is at a lower level than you are on the ramp leading to KT's room, he frequently bugs out and can't path to you properly and doesn't cast bombs at you when you're at max range from him so you take next to no damage from him. Staff of Disintegration aura will stop Remote Toy from stunning you. Continue your burn and blow Capernian up. Mage ward/mana shield as much as possible here to minimize damage. Blow Sanguinar up when he arrives, then evocate / bandage to full. When Thaladred arrives, kite him around a bit till cooldowns (images in particular) are back up, but try to kill him close to KT's room door. You shouldn't take any damage from him.\n\nPhase 4: The difficult part (gear check). Counterspell first fireball. Blow KT up ASAP with all cooldowns + time warp. There are two ways to do this phase: Either use images and LOS around the wall of the room outside KT's door until he casts an MC, then blow time warp + cooldowns and kill him, or just blow cooldowns + images, iceblock the MC if he gets you with it and kill him. The first method is what you will do if your gear is mediocre (390ish). Either way kill him. Swap back to your normal weapon for 15 seconds after he casts Arcane Disruption if you like for more damage. Note when he casts Shock Barrier/Pyroblast he will target [b]you[/b] with Pyroblast regardless of whether images are up or not, and Phoenixes will always target you. So have counterspell available for this scenario. He must be pushed to 50% before you run out of cooldowns / mana and die.\n\nEvocate and bandage in the transition. Kill any phoenixes and eggs that are up here.\n\nPhase 5: Currently bugged but doable. Continue using Staff of Disintegration and swapping back to your normal weapon for 15 seconds after Arcane Disruption casts. He will teleport you to him. Slowfall or blink to avoid fall damage from bugged Gravity Lapse, stand at range, blow Phoenixes or eggs up and ignore KT until shock barrier ends. CS first fireball after this, use cooldowns + images again after the next Arcane Disruption (if your images are disoriented he will target you), collect loot. Don't stand in flamestrike during this phase, if it does hit you it's 120k damage.\n\nIt's pretty tough but fun.\n\nNote: Al'ar and all trash from the entrance to KT's room must be cleared, but I did not need to kill VR or his trash, or Astromancer and her trash. Al'ar as arcane is more or less \"stand there and DPS boss until it flies off, evocate, stand there and DPS boss until it dies\".", "date": "2012-01-27T18:39:23-06:00", "rating": 7, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-02-02T10:52:43-06:00", 3, "citrique"]}

Bandages will come in handy as well. My gearscore at the time was 380. Feral is my offspec. \r\nThis is my spec and glyphs: http://www.wowhead.com/talent#0ZrbMfRurzRczMcu:qM0firm  You could probably drop natural reaction/thick hide for dps talents since you'll be in cat form most of the time and the majority of KT's damage is from fire, but it's up to you. \r\n\r\nI clear Alar and all his trash before the fight. At no point when Thaladred is up do you want be suspended in the air for too long, otherwise you'll be teleported to him. This means don't jump off the ramp in alar's room and get near a wall for capernian's arcane burst in p3. DBM timers for TK will help you a lot. \r\n\r\n[u][b]Phase 1: [/b][/u]\r\nStart the boss and run to the very front of the instance. This is where you will kill Thaladred and Sanguinar. Be careful not to get feared or knocked back out the entrance portal. When Sanguinar dies, run up the left ramp in Alar's room and los Capernian behind a nook in the wall. When she gets in range charge her and dot her up fast. You can trinket a conflag but her arcane burst debuff will still be annoying. Drag Telonicus to the entrance of KT's room and bring him to around 20%. Keep LB on yourself and kill him when your remote toy debuff is about to run out. \r\n\r\n[u][b]Phase 2:[/b][/u]\r\nPosition yourself in the left corner in the corridor outside kt's room. LB yourself x3 and cast thorns. Go cat and pop barkskin, berserk, and survival instincts. Spam swipe till just the cosmic infuser and phaseshift bulwark are up. You can target the cosmic infuser for interrupts during this part. Dot up the phaseshift bulwark and loot the Staff of Disintegration and Cosmic Infuser. You will want macros ready for both of these on your bar.\r\n/equip Staff of Disintegration\r\n/use Staff of Disintegration\r\n\r\n/equip Cosmic Infuser\r\n\r\nYou will also want your ordinary weapon on your bar for easy switching back and forth. Equip and use the staff in preparation for phase 3.\r\n[b][u]\r\nPhase 3:[/u][/b] \r\nLb x3 and thorns yourself before telonicus comes up. Dps him down as fast as possible, and keep him near the door to KT's room. Capernian will show up when he is around 40%. Range pull her into the tiny room outside KT's room, otherwise she'll arcane burst you very far away. Don't worry much about your health while you fight her, just get her down fast. Sanguinar will likely show up when she is almost dead. You can swap to your normal weapon now because you don't need the staff buff anymore. Heal yourself up while you're fighting sanguinar using instant heals. You have awhile before Thaladred shows up, but don't dawdle because you don't want phase 4 starting with thaladred at full health. I use barkskin and tiger's fury for thaladred, burning him down and running away with a fresh rip on him when I have 4 stacks of his rend. Heal yourself up while you run down the ramp in Alar's room. \r\n\r\n[u][b]Phase 4:    [/b][/u]\r\nI fight the entirety of this phase near the bottom of the ramp in alar's room. The key to this phase is keeping up the 50% less fire damage buff from the Cosmic Infuser while you have the staff equipped. Fireball interrupts help, but make sure to save your skull bash cd for pyroblasts. Once you get used to killing the advisors in time this is definitely the hardest phase.  \r\nEquip the cosmic infuser, LBx3 and thorns when you see KT enter alar's room, then equip and use the staff. Charge KT and go to town on him. He will barrier and start pyroblasting relatively soon. I usually barkskin his first pyro and interrupt the second. I don't bother dpsing down phoenix eggs as I like to stay on kt for interrupts, but this is up to you. You may have 3 phoenixes beating on you by the time phase 5 triggers. I save my pvp trinket if I accidentally take an arcane disruption while healing with cosmic infuser, because the 10 second disorient usually means a wipe. Every 30 seconds you need to heal with the cosmic infuser equipped, otherwise his fire damage starts to hurt a lot more. Eating a pyroblast without the cosmic infuser buff up may mean a wipe. You only have to last till 50%, so if you're in a tight spot use a health pot or go bear and frenzied regen/survival instincts. \r\n[u]\r\n[b]Phase 5:  [/b][/u]\r\nIf you successfully make it to phase 5 then congrats, you will probably kill him. When KT hits 50% he will run all the way back to his room. You want to get him as low as possible during his run back. Equip your main weapon for this part of the fight. Dash and stampeding roar in order to keep up with him. Berserk and do a normal raid rotation on him (yay shred). You won't be able to keep up with him when he's almost to his room, so try and leave a fresh rip. Heal up outside his room while you wait on him. If any phoenixes catch up to you go ahead and kill them. If you want to play it safe (and depending on how low you got him while he was running back) you can do the same cosmic infuser/staff rotation for this phase. Otherwise just use your main weapon and trinket arcane disruption while you burn him down. You don't have to interrupt pyroblast during this phase so interrupt fireballs on cd. When he casts gravity lapse move to the corridor outside the tiny room so you arent hit with the max health decrease debuff. When gravity lapse ends go back in, zerk and kill him. I usually only have 1 gravity lapse go off.\r\n\r\nThat's it folks! I spent about 5 hours wiping to this fight before I consistently got to phase 4, so patience and practice is key. Lots of people have timing issues on the first 3 phases. Just stay cat form and dps hard, I never use bear form until phase 4. I'm planning on frapsing a kill eventually, so I'll post the link here. *youtube.com/watch?v=c5QTVj16Kf0 is a feral druid solo vid I watched when learning the fight, but I stagger the advisors in phase 3 a lot more and kill the weapons in a different spot.

He should die at the entrance of that room, near the ramp.\r\n5) Next up, Grand Astromancer Capernian. Run back to the entrance of the instance and wait for her. The goal is to have her die close to where you killed the 1st boss, Thaladred. Stay out of LoS until she runs into one of the tighter corridor spaces, then quickly run out, put your back against the wall and open up on her hard. Feel free to use your wings+zeal (save guardian) and they'll be back when you need them again. If she Conflagrates you (10 sec cc; incredibly annoying), don't bubble out of it. Just wait it out or use your racial if you're Human.\r\n6) Once she's dead head into Al'ar's room and wait at the top of the ramp that is on the opposite side of the corridor without trash. When Master Engineer Telonicus appears, run around the opposite way that he heads in order to get into the clear corridor with him chasing you. So if he heads down the ramp, you run around up the top, and vice versa. Your goal is to head back to the entrance to Kael'thas' room. When you get there, Telonicus should arrive a few seconds later and start throwing bombs. If he hasn't already done so, he'll place the Remote Toy debuff on you, which will occasionally stun you for 4 seconds. This debuff lasts 1 minute. This will be gone soon enough. Depending on how quickly you kill him, it may already be gone before the start of the next phase. Make sure to kill him before it is refreshed in any case. Divine Protection glyphed will cut the damage from his bombs significantly.\r\n\r\nPHASE 2:\r\n\r\n7) Stay behind a wall and LoS the weapons out into the open corridor. Change seals to Righteousness and begin AoEing. Loot the Cosmic Infuser (gives a helpful buff) and the Phaseshift Bulwark (absorbs 100k damage for 4 secs and some cc immunity -- incase something goes wrong). Kill the weapons and then heal up. Wait next to Telonicus' body until the next phase begins. Ideally you should have 3 Holy Power saved up, with Inquisition active (fish for procs on the weapons before you kill the last of them).\r\n\r\nPHASE 3:\r\n\r\n8) When Telonicus engages again, open up on him hard but don't use cooldowns. You shouldn't need to. He will put Remote Toy on you again. Simply endure it and kill him. When he's dead, Sanguinar will soon come running up. Dispatch him too. If Remote Toy is becoming a problem, use CDs and bubble it off when Capernian gets in range. That way you can deal some damage to her as well without taking any for a bit. Either way, finish Capernian off as fast as you can, using wings+zeal if need be. Last is Thaladred. Simple nuke. Feel free to kite him to prevent taking any damage from his Rend (which still hurts a lot if you let it stack). When they're all dead, make your way back to the entrance of Al'ar's room, at the bottom of the ramp.\r\n\r\nPHASE 4:\r\n\r\n9) Kael'thas will come running into Al'ar's room. Engage him as soon as he's in the open. He will put up a Shock Barrier soon after reaching Al'ar's room and then spam Pyroblast, which hits for a ton. Use your CDs and hit him hard, making sure to interrupt Pyroblast once his barrier falls. When he hits 50% he'll run back to his room. Chase him and keep DPSing (use a Swiftness potion to keep up for more damage if you want). The lower you can get him before he gets inside his room, the quicker the last phase will be, and the less risky it will be. You can also interrupt his basic Fireball casts as well when his Shock Barrier is on CD. Switching the Cosmic Infuser in and using a heal will cut his damage by 50% for 30 seconds, too. Note that you should also kill the Phoenix and the Phoenix Eggs that spawn or you may find yourself becoming overwhelmed if your DPS isn't up to par. Oh, one more thing, he might do an Arcane Explosion-type attack that will disorient you for about 10 seconds. Just wait it out unless he also puts up Shock Barrier during this time, in which case, trinket/bubble out of it and burn the barrier down ASAP then interrupt Pyroblast.\r\n\r\nPHASE 5:\r\n\r\n10) After the roleplay, let Kael'thas run back to Al'ar's room for more space. When he does Gravity Lapse, float down and open up hard on him. Avoid the purple beams as they debuff you with -10% Max Health and this lasts for 1 minute. Bubble it off if you get too many (6+). Kill him fast. Job done! His damage output in this phase is very low and only becomes a problem if you let yourself float into the beams too often, thereby reducing your max health to the point where he can kill you in a few hits.\r\n\r\nHope you find this helpful.

However, when you've got some DS gear (mostly Raid Finder level Gurthalak or better as your 2H), you can just fight him straight up in the boss room.  The only reason you couldn't do this before was when gear was lower and your weapon wasn't as good, you couldn't take all four advisors on at once without dying because you'd be fighting them way too long, mostly due to Capernian's irritating abilities that move you out of melee range and put a long disorient on you. However, with a strong enough weapon and popping some DPS CDs, you can now get Capernian down fast enough that you aren't fighting her without AMS's protection for very long.  \r\n\r\nWhen you do it this way, fight the advisors normally, but put Thaldred and Sanguinar in the corners of Kael's room so you can avoid a little bit of the damage when you get to Phase 3, and just down Capernian and Telonicus near Kael himself.  Kill the weapons pronto, and wait for Kael to start talking about making you fight all four at once.  I usually will try to pop Army, regular ghoul and such right around here.  The key to doing it this way is making sure to pop AMS so it has as much effective uptime as possible, but before Capernian can cause you to lose control of your character through the disorient.  You want to just rip Capernian down as fast as possible since her disorients and knockbacks are basically the only reason you couldn't do this fight this way before this gear level.  \r\n\r\nKael is fought basically the same way as in every other strategy, although if you fight him in the room, he won't really get to Pyroblast before you get him to 50% since he doesn't have travel time from his room to wherever you were fighting him (usually Al'ar's room or the hallway outside).", "date": "2012-05-14T14:55:33-05:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Fighting him with Gurthalak is a stupid idea, if the tentacle props he can mind control you, kill the tentacle and it resets the fight.", "creationdate": "2012-05-29T07:49:12-05:00", "id": 546438, "rating": 1, "commentid": 1666927, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "800998", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Not really - I've killed him like 13 times with Gurthalak and never had it happen once.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 197, "id": 1693819, "nreplies": 1, "sticky": 0, "user": "Forumchibi", "body": "After trying for three days straight with my friend, we finally got Kael'thas duo'd tonight.\r\n\r\nWe went through a few class combinations - paladin/shaman, mage/shaman, hunter/hunter - and on our successful attempt used hunter/shaman.  I went BM with a turtle pet, and the shaman was elemental spec.\r\n\r\nWe repeatedly had difficulty killing the council in the room, and had much better attempts using the halls between the room and the entrance.\r\n\r\nWe fought Thaladred in Al'ar's room by the top of the ramp, Sanguinar in the hall just outside Al'ar's room going toward Kael'thas, Capernian at the entrance, and Telonicus at the door to Kael'thas.\r\n\r\nWe burned them down individually easy enough.  For the weapons, we focused on the shield first, then the healing mace, then killed the rest one by one.  Both of us looted the Staff of Disintegration and used the effect, and I also picked up the Infinity Blade in case CC needed to be removed.\r\n\r\nI created two macros specifically for swapping between the staff and blade in case my partner got MC'd, which he did on a few of the attempts, so they were helpful to have if you have a more aggressive/reckless friend.\r\n\r\n#showtooltip\r\n#show Cobra Shot\r\n/equip Staff of Disintegration\r\n/use Staff of Disintegration\r\n/cast Cobra Shot\r\n\r\n#showtooltip\r\n#show Raptor Strike\r\n/equip Infinity Blade\r\n/cast Raptor Strike\r\n\r\nBecause the Raptor Strike was modified to equip the dagger, it reduced the effort of putting on the dagger and spamming the melee ability required to break CC to one button, and then once they were free I was immediately able to switch back to and use the staff and attack with the modified Cobra Shot to minimize me getting disoriented, again with a single button.\r\n\r\nWe were able to kill the council one or two at a time without much issue as they reached us.  Once Kael'thas went active, we went back to the doorway between Al'ar's room and the hallway toward Kael'thas's room.  Originally we tried in the small room and hallway just outside his door, and at the intersection just down the hall, but they didn't work very well.  Because there were two of us, when the tanking turtle got disoriented, Kael'thas would run out toward us and would sometimes stand in the doorway, giving us no place to hide from the MC, and of course only I could drop my aggro with Feign while the shaman could only run around.  Being at the door outside of Al'ar's room gave us two doors to run through - in case he ran into Al'ar's room or all the way back into the hallway side, we could both just run through to the other side and hide again.\r\n\r\nThe turtle needed an occasional heal from me, but otherwise we hid a lot, waited, and came out just after the MC messages of 'Obey me!' and 'Bow to my will!'.  I tried to use the in-game stopwatch to measure 30 seconds, but usually was scrambling to much to start or reset it, so just went with a rough estimate and hid early.\r\n\r\nWe also killed Al'ar at some point, because in one attempt, as Kael'thas ran back to his room at 50%, we got Al'ar's aggro.  I'm not sure if we accidentally hit him or what.\r\n\r\nOnce Kael'thas had run off, we waited until he teleported and summoned us in the doorway outside his room.  I temporarily put my pet on passive and made sure we had a good view of Kael'thas and the pet in the open hallway before attacking.  The shaman did end up healing a few times, and I also had to res my pet at least twice (I wasn't watching the stacking debuff on it), but we finally killed him.\r\n\r\nHe was enough nice enough to drop the Ashes on our first kill for all our troubles :)  It took a lot of learning of where to go and what to use (and over the course of the three days I was running dungeons to gear up my hunter), but it was well worth the effort.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 202, "id": 1707677, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "lightclaw", "body": "Soloing this as a feral druid is fun, but a bit complicated.  I'm sure it will be easier at level 90, but at 85 it's still easy to die trying.  I attempted to do it in bear form but the changes to Vengeance make it so that your dps is just too low to get the advisors down fast enough the second time you face them.  In cat form it was substantially easier.  I also tried completing the fight with a healer friend, but that actually wound up making the fight harder due to Kael'thas's mind controls.\n\nThe fight is vastly easier with a PvP trinket.  Throughout the encounter, be sure to keep bleeds going as much as possible and use the free healing touches you get from finishing moves to heal up.  Bandages and Renew can pretty much do the rest to keep you alive, but things like barkskin and the bear healing buffs are helpful, of course.\n\nStart the fight and run all the way to the raid's entrance.  Thaladred is slow, but he will eventually get there.  Kill him and wait for the second advisor, Sanguinar.  \n\nKill Sanguinar at the raid entrance as well, then return to the entrance of the Phoenix Room and wait for the third advisor, Capernian.\n\nWhen she begins down the left ramp toward you, run up the right ramp and around on the balcony, and kite her all the way back to the west door to the boss's room.  Fight her in the alcove leading to the boss room, or her knockbacks will be a real problem.  Use your PvP trinket to escape the conflagration effect she puts on you.  \n\nOnce Capernian is dead, run to the middle of the Void Reaver's room and wait for Telonicus to show up.  He puts an annoying debuff on you that stuns you periodically.  Hit him a few times to get his health down but run in circles to avoid bombs and wait until the Remote Toy debuff has about 10-15 seconds left before finishing him off.  \n\nAfter the last advisor is killed, run back to the west ramp leading to Kael'thas's room and LoS the weapons around the corner.  AoE them down, keeping the Cosmic Infuser targeted, and interrupting its heals.  Don't bother picking up any of the weapons.  (If the fight continues to give you problems, try picking up the Staff of Disintegration.  Equip and use it to gain the buff that nullifies the conflagration and stun effects.  Wear this when for the remainder of the fight.  Your dps will suffer a lot, but you can put your PvE trinket back on and you won't have to worry about conflagrates ever.  It's doable either way, but faster without messing with the Staff.)\n\nRun back to the corpse of Capernian near the boss room.  Nuke her down, again using your trinket to get out of the conflagrate.  The advisors should come to you one by one, giving you just enough time to finish one before the next appears.  You'll get the Remote Toy debuff again, but there's nothing you can do about it, so just burn the guy as fast as possible.  If necessary, run down to meet Thaladred so that the phase transition doesn't happen while he's still up.\n\nWhen the 4th advisor is dead again, Kael'thas comes out to fight.  I fought him right in the west doorway to his room.  Stay out of the fire, burn down any eggs you see, and make sure to keep your bleeds on him to knock down his health.  When he puts up Shock Barrier, break it down (do 80k damage) and prepare to interrupt his Pyroblasts.  Save your PvP trinket for this purpose at this point in the fight.  He will conflagrate you fairly often, but if you get conflagged and he starts pyroblasting, it's a wipe.  At 50% he runs away (still bleeding, hopefully) and transforms.  If there are any adds around, kill them, then heal up for phase 5.\n\nHe comes back supersized and does a new ability or two.  When he casts gravity lapse, run fairly far away and just wait.  He'll be shooting you with Nether Beams, but they don't do much damage and can be countered with Renew's ticks alone.  If you get too close you get a ticking debuff that decreases your max health by 10% per stack, up to 9 stacks.  You should never get any.  Once that spell phase is over, about 30 seconds, he will run toward you and start casting fireballs again.  Keep bleeding him and killing eggs and he dies fairly easily.  You might have to kite him all the way back to the Phoenix room to finish him.\n\nBest of luck on the Ashes.", "date": "2012-09-01T16:05:58-05:00", "rating": 8, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-09-07T00:11:41-05:00", 2, "lightclaw"]}

Preparation also helps on this, resets the cd of cloak of shadows, which can also be used earlier to remove remote toy.\r\n\r\nP5 was easier, maybe because of a better management of feint on my part also, and I was always around 160k hp (no first aid... else it'd have been easier, got it on warrior) during nether beams, then went down till 90k while fighting, then again 160k.\r\n\r\nAlso, prismatic elixir used, nothing else.\r\n\r\n4) Now, hardest, 89 mage: human racial is a pvp trinket, so I could use my full mop questing gear. Same kiting position of the adds as on warrior, used mirror images on weapons and killed the bulwark first, because it stops you from casting for 8 sec.\r\n\r\nThen, for capernian, you can outrange her, you have to go AGAINST kt room, she won't be able to target you with conflagration, so you don't need to equip the staff (but still loot it!) in p3 and then nuke her, then engineer, then sanguinar, then thaladred.\r\n\r\nAlways keep ice barrier up, that's the key for doing it as mage, and I also recommend using cold snap talent for healing + iceblock reset, and evocation glyph absolutely!\r\n\r\nPhase 4 and 5 were literally INSANE as mage, after a few wipes I decided to equip the staff of the encounter (legendary, and level 70) always, so that he couldn't disorient me, this also means way lower dps, though.\r\n\r\nTW immediately, no images during p4 due to mind control, counterspelled as many fireballs as I could, when he did a flame strike under me instant blink, ice barrier always up, iceblock on pyroblasts, then cold snap to heal and iceblock again on next series of pyroblasts.\r\n\r\nWent to a point in p4 in which out of desperation due to healing expired (both cold snap and evocation on cd) I started running away from him with blink, and this works fine to avoid fireballs and letting cds come ready again, BUT he still does pyroblast, so you have to have something ready, and I think cold snap came ready again, so I healed like 76k with it and iceblocked just in time.\r\n\r\nEvocation also is particularly useful, it heals 60% of your hp and he cannot interrupt it; just make sure to do it not just before a flame strike, I had to blink out once interrupting my evocation! And at level 90 invocation talent is incredibly OP; seems like evocation would only heal 40% but 10 sec cd, so just spam that to full hp, lol.\r\n\r\nSo with some kiting to let my healing cds come ready again, I managed to get him to p5, even here with sooooo low hp left, but during the roleplay I managed to do an evocation, and ofc used slowfall in case of fall damage on nether beams.\r\n\r\nAll was going fine on p5, no mind control = you can use images every 5 min to distract him, and no pyroblasts = you can iceblock some fireballs.\r\n\r\nThe problem I got was my low dps, the staff effect still had 5 mins but surprisingly I got disoriented, that was because the staff itself has a limited duration.\r\n\r\nSo the last 300-400k was a nightmare, but just before I died an ice barrier came ready, so managed to kill him in time.\r\n\r\nOnly buff used was a 300 int flask, didn't want to spend a fortune on 1.000 int flasks, but they help, definitely, more than the prismatic elixir, doesn't work on almost anything.\r\n\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/213/thas632k.jpg/\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/526/thassolo.jpg/\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/20/ar66runstotal1runonmage.jpg/", "date": "2012-10-10T11:06:50-05:00", "rating": 7, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "what do you mean go against kt room? how is she not able to use conflag?", "creationdate": "2012-10-30T10:46:26-05:00", "id": 593015, "rating": 0, "commentid": 1737456, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Racthoh", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

I'm just going to explain it step by step.\nIn MoP his health got a boost but thats just for the statistics. Any hunter spec will be fine at the moment as your dps is high enough, i am using Survival for the DoT's and good AoE. Just take Spirit Bond for a minor self-heal and use a tank pet if your unsure (i'm using my dps wolf).  You should always start out with a dps pet.\n\n[b][u]Phase 1[/u][/b]\nIn the first phase i suggest you kill the first 2 adds at the entrance of the room (Thaladred and Blood lord). Kill the third (Capernian) near Kaelthas, this is done for convience in the third phase. I suggest killing the fourth add (Telonicus) half way towards the entrance, mainly to avoid the Remote Toy debuff which stuns you. You might want to change to a tank pet after you killed the  adds.\n\n[b][u]Phase 2[/u][/b]\nIn phase 2 the weapons will spawn, just AoE them down. With the current dps it doesnt really matter which weapon you target. The Cosmic Infuser heals the other weapons for a fair bit so if you dont have high enough AoE damage this will be your first target.\n\n[b][u]Phase 3[/u][/b]\nIn phase 3 the adds obviously spawn again. Your priority in killing them is Capernian>Telonicus>Thaladred (unable to keep on the pet)>Sanguine. Capernian should be close to where you killed the weapons. Try to stand a little behind Kael'thas, so your out range for the knockback, with Misdirection up for your pet. Nuke Capernian down as soon as she spawns. This way you avoid alot of nasty and annoying cc's. Second up is Telonicus. Just kill him fast so you can avoid the Remote Toy debuff. After he is down, kill Thaladred, nothing special here. With one add left i suggest you place (move to option) your pet in between one of the two big statues and Kael'thas. Position yourself JUST behind the statue. Dont go all the way around, a part of the statues cloak will suffice for LoS (just try it with the add if you are unsure).  You dont want to be to far from your pet or else you will get frequently disorientated for 10 seconds. This is preperation for the next phase. Kill the last add when you are in position and without the Remote toy debuff.\n\n[b][u]Phase 4[/u][/b]\nThe fourth phase used to take a while in Cataclysm, but can be done swiftly now without getting mindcontrolled. Kael'thas should be running towards you, quickly Misdirect him on your pet and let your pet attack. I suggest you pull him with Murder of Crows, Serpent String or Black Arrow. Immediately after you have Misdirected him on your pet, LoS him and let your pet attack. This might be the best point to use your Stampede cooldown. Not long after this Kael'thas will yell 'Obey me' or 'Bow to my will', which tells when he has cast his Mind Control. This is when you step out of the LoS and dps him hard for around 20 seconds, which is the cooldown of the mindcontrol. Kaelthas should go down pretty fast. At 1,5m health the last phase will start. If he casts Pyroblast, just eat it and dps through his shield. This gives you another 10 seconds of 'free' damage.\n\n[b][u]Phase 5[/u][/b]\nFor the last phase place your pet in the middle of the room, in between the 2 statues. This is to avoid the health debuf and accidently killing the pet (really important in Cata, less now but keep an eye on it if you are using a dps pet). You have to hide COMPLETELY behind the statue now because Kael'thas sometimes uses a random Mind Control when he lands back on the ground which can screw up the whole fight. When he has landed, just misdirect him on your pet and dps him down. Gravity lapse got fixed (used to smack you to the ground) so it isnt a real problem anymore. Avoid getting close so you wont get the health debuf.\n\nThis is basically the whole fight, might have forgotten some things.

I kite her very close to the entrance to the zone. Burn her down.\r\n(4) kite the engineer to a point ~half the distance you kited the third advisor. I kited him into the hallway that leads to Void Reaver. Do this so the caster and the engineer don't arrive to you at the same time in phase 3. Burn him down.\r\n\r\nPhase 2\r\n(5) sprint back to the door where you killed the first two advisors and burn down all of the weapons there. I haven't found it necessary to equip the weapons, plus I can't equip a staff anyhow. So I just wait there for phase 3.\r\n\r\nPhase 3\r\n(6) Pop your DPS cooldowns and nuke the two advisors there as fast as possible. Ideally they will both die before the engineer arrives, but if not the engineer debuff isn't that bad and can be CoS'd. Kill the engineer, and hopefully this occurs before the caster advisor gets to you. Kill the caster advisor\r\n\r\nPhase 4\r\n(7) Hang out by the door for Kael'thas to do his monologue and his gingerly walk over to you, just hang in there and DPS him and allow yourself to regain some health back if needed. So far I haven't worried too much about his special abilities in this phase\r\n\r\nPhase 5\r\n(8) Just DPS him some more. Indeed watch out for nether beam if you get it, it surprised me once, but you can CoS out of it.\r\n\r\nThe primary difference between this approach and the method for ranged DPS and casters is the priority for killing the advisors. For melee it is difficult to DPS the caster advisor down because she will arcane blast you when you get in melee range, and then the whole conflagration business starts a never-ending cycle of suck that winds up with you paying gold for gear repairs after you die a pathetic death. With that in mind:\r\n\r\nThe first two advisors hit the hardest, I think, and with the potential to be perpetually stunned or disoriented it should be a priority for melee to down these two first.\r\n\r\nThe engineer has an annoying stun, but it can be CoS'd, so if you wind up with him and the first two advisors alive it is still possible to survive and DPS the bunch\r\n\r\nThe caster is the main problem, so my approach basically just leaves her for the very end so you can DPS her down while you inevitably get disoriented for 6 secs without worrying about the other advisors beating up on you or catching up to you.\r\n\r\nFor rogues, use shiv, feint, and recuperate whenever possible. I know it is probably obvious to say so, but it was something new I learned about playing a rogue. I'm not a PvP person, so usually I focus on DPS and how to do more of it. But after trying to solo a bit more, survivability is a key issue and it was fun to open up this part of the class and learn a bit more about rogues.\r\n\r\nCheers, and good luck on getting the mount", "date": "2013-01-07T20:01:44-06:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

I was most successful using my Terrorguard.  Keep it out until you fight KT himself.\n\n2) First phase of mini-bosses:  At the beginning of the fight, head back to the end of the room where you came in to fight the first 2 mini-bosses.  Then fight Capernian where she is, or even back behind KT.  The idea is to separate her as much as possible from the others since this is where they will be when they get resurrected.  Try to fight Telonicus back by the entrance as well.\n\n3) Weapons:  Burn down the staff first.  Equip it AND use it (right-click).  It really helps to have a button or hotkey for it.  The hotkey will both equip it and activate it - but you have to click it twice, once to equip and once to activate.  Also put your own weapon on a hotkey/button for later.  Once you do this, burn down each of the other weapons.  I found it fastest doing one at a time - trying to AoE them took too long.\n\n4) Once the weapons are down, get to a spot as far away from the melee bosses as possible but close enough to Capernian.  Pop your cooldowns and burn her down as fast as possible.  Then take down whoever happens to be pounding on you at the moment.  :)\n\n5) Once the mini-bosses are down, immediately dismiss your pet.  [s]At this point you can equip your own weapon again for added DPS.[/s]  EDIT: DON'T re-equip your own weapon, he can still occasionally disorient you at any time - it just didn't happen the first time I took him down.\n\n6) For KT himself: Keep Corruption and Doom up, and use Hand of Gul'dan whenever you can.  Spend the rest of the time with Drain Life.  If you see circles appear under you, obviously GTFO.  Keep your distance in general, especially for his 2nd phase - he has some insta-death ability that got me a couple of times before I realized I was too close.  \n\nYou can pretty much ignore the phoenixes he summons.  I have the Harvest Life talent, so draining him also drained the phoenixes and eggs nearby.  Therefore I was happy when he summoned them - more life for me :)  \n\nWhen he levitates you up in the air, make sure you float yourself down (same as you do when on a flying mount).  That will prevent falling damage when he lets go.  You can refresh your DoTs or use Fel Flame or Hand of Gul'dan while in the air.\n\nHope this helps!", "date": "2013-02-18T12:42:20-06:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2013-02-20T22:31:04-06:00", 2, "65183"]}

Kill the bow (the last remaining weapon) and run to the back of the room.  The four minions you previously killed are about to revive.\n\n[u][b]Phase 3 (moderate)[/b][/u]\nFour of his minions are now going to attack.   Send your blueberry to the mage, then to the hunter.  He should be able to grab their aggro with a hit or two.   There are going to be two melee minions chasing you.  Run around the room in a wide perimeter constantly refreshing dots as they chase you.  Demon form helps tremendously as the main attack is instant, so use it when you can.\n\nWhen the minions are near death pull them toward the statue of KT located at the NE corner of the room.  Have KT targeted and get ready to sick your blueberry on him.\n\n[b]It is now safe to re-equip your main hand![/b]\n\n[u][b]Phase 4 (moderate)[/b][/u]\nThe biggest issue with Phase 4 is KT's mind control.  While you can dismiss your pet and tank him yourself, I found this to be tough in Demonology spec.  So, let's have our blueberry do the work for us.\n\nAs soon as this phase begins sick your blueberry on him and hide behind the statue.   The idea is that the statue blocks line of sight, so when KT casts mind control it will not affect us.   You can tell when KT has cast the mind control by looking for him saying \"OBEY ME!\" or \"BOW TO MY WILL!\".  After he says this run from behind the statue and DPS him for 20 seconds, then run back behind the statue.\n\nAn egg will drop occasionally and summon a phoenix which causes AoE damage.   If possible, kill the egg.  If it hatches into a phoenix kill the phoenix, which turns into an egg, then kill the egg.  More eggs will spawn over this phase.\n\n[u][b]Phase 5 (easy)[/b][/u]\nThis is a burn phase.   He's going to cast a flying debuff.

If you are BM you either respec for this fight, or you use a different approach. Reason: Since you will be dismissing your pet, you will 'throw away' your biggest dps output. So, obvious that it's a nogo there!\n[/b]\n\nClear your way up to Kael'thas, have your pet up and engage him.\n[b]Phase 1:[/b] First 4 adds are almost onehits, shouldn't be a problem (if you fail here, go grind lvl 3 boars).\n\n[b]Phase 2:[/b] Show those legendary weapons they aren't as legendary as they think and just AOE everything down (don't loot/equip any of them). Take a 2 min break, as it takes a while until next phase will start.\n\n[b]Phase 3:[/b] When 4 new adds pop up, nuke the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=20062]Grand Astromancer Capernian[/url] first (she disorients), [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=20060]Lord Sacond[/url] (he fears), [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=20063]Master Engineer Telonicus[/url] next (he does the Remote Toy stun). Then wait untill the stun wears off and finally kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=20060]Lord Sanguinar[/url] (he does this knockback, which is basically a free disengage). This phase is the hardest as it can be annoying to kill all adds while constantly being cc'ed. Optionally you can spec BM and let your pet do [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=38484]all of the work[/url]\n\n[b]Phase 4:[/b]\n[b]Immediately[/b] after the last add is down, dismiss your pet [b](so make sure you cannot be stunned by Remote Toy during the dismiss pet - cast)[/b] and dps Kael'thas down to 50%.\nIgnore all Phoenix and just keep on dps'ing. You will get stunned once for 8 seconds, but your dots will keep on ticking. If you are a bit undergeared and you are near dead, just bring a potion or a health stone. Again, it is very important to not have your pet active in this phase, as he will mindcontrol you otherwise and the fight will reset. If you are decent geared [b](ilvl 470+)[/b], you will end this phase with 30-40% health. [b]Do not use stampede or dire beast in this phase![/b] If there is something else on the aggro-table besides you, you will get mind controlled. Engineering stuff like [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=77530]this funky trinket [/url] will mess things up and reset the fight.\n\nOnce Kael'thas is at 50% he will lose focus on you and run back to his spawn point. If you killed the last add near the end of the room, he has to make a very long run. If you play this well, you can chase him while dps'ing and get him easily to 30%. \n\nOnce he starts floating in the air, profit and re-gen.

When he starts charging you, get your pet back out and just tank and spank him. This part of the fight should not take more then 15-20 seconds, so you should not worry about nasty debuffs. \n\nIf you are knocked up in the air, swim back down without touching the ground, to avoid fall damage.\n\nDue to internal timers, the fight takes about 5-6 minutes and is really worth the effort.\nAt lvl 90, the biggest trouble is getting to Tempest Keep, not killing KT.\n\nIf you want more info, just click my name and contact me in game.\n\nEdit: format and typo's", "date": "2013-03-25T09:44:15-05:00", "rating": -4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not sure if you meant ilvl 480+ or not because at ilvl 460 (roughly 338k for my hunter) dismissing my pet only made things worse (I am BM) as he simply crit me to death.

Some MoP gear is crucial.  Each piece I acquired made this encounter much easier.  Took some time to figure it out, but with the help of other comments here, it has become simple.  Here's how I do it:\n\nSpec: Demonology\nGlyphs: Imp Swarm, Healthstone, Corruption (optional; initially used Demon Hunting for Apotheosis, but I've found it's not necessary)\nTalents: Soul Leech, Mortal Coil, Dark Bargain, [I find Lvl 60 talent is unimportant though maybe Unbound Will could be useful despite its health cost], Grim. Supremacy or Sacrifice\nPet: Felguard/Wrathguard for Phases 1 and 2; Fel Imp or Sacrifice for Phase 3.  \n\nPhase 1: As mentioned in other useful posts, kill Copernican on the far side of the room by the entrance and the others behind Sunstrider.  Phase 1 goes very quickly.  Usually pop imp swarm and dark soul on Thaladred to speed things up initially.  Hopefully you clear this phase without that stupid toy on you.  \n\nPhase 2: Use a lot of AOE, let the pet do much of the work, drain life if you need to heal back up after Ph.1.  You can be conservative with your Dem. Fury here, should be fine without burning it.  You want a full tank for Ph. 3.  \n\nPhase 3:  After killing weapons, run to the far side and wait on the res, getting ready to burst Copernican.  I put my pet closer to her than I am so he gets the first CC.   As soon as she becomes targetable, pop your Imp Swarm, Dark Soul, and Doom Guard, and unload.  You might get cc'ed before she goes down; pop your trinket on her CC if you have to.  She should die from the imps and pets even if you have to make a run for it when the other three arrive.   When Copernican is down, try to take down Telonicus next.  You'll probably get hit with the Toy, so you want time for it to wear off before they all die.  If you still have Toy on you at the start of Phase 4, you're in trouble.   You're gonna have to heal, dps, and run, but you should be able to find a rhythm.  Corruption glyph is useful to keep your health up on the run when you don't have time to Drain Life and your other heals are on CD.   If you're gonna go into Apotheosis, wait at least until Copernican is down, ideally after Copernican and Telonicus are down.    Be prepared to res your pet on the run; it will probably die during this phase.  \n\nPhase 4: This was actually a challenge for me at first, even after clearing Phase 3.  Grim Sacrifice is useful to give yourself more burst, better Soul Leech shielding, and better dps efficiency when healing with Drain Life, but you don't necessarily need it.  MAKE SURE to put away your tanking pet before engaging KT.  If you're going to use a pet, Imp is ideal because you can heal with Cauterize aand the imp won't take KT's aggro; you MUST hold aggro of he'll mind control you and it's game over.   You shold be able to pop Imp Swarm whenever it's up without an aggro issue.  Apotheosis will help hold aggro but shouldn't be necessary; I personally don't like it because of the weak dps.   increased damage from Demon Form (especially with DS) burns him down quicker and gives you better shielding from Soul Leech anyway.  You're going to have to rotate heals, Drain Life and DPSing, and always keep some Fury in reserve so you can throw Carrion Swarms to interrupt his Pyroblasts.  \n\nThe first and second stages of this phase really shouldn't differ much in strategy other than \"swimming\" away when you get tossed up into the air.  You want to use your in-the-air time for your instant casts, recast Corruption if needed, Hand of G, go demon form and throw some ToCs, etc.  You shouldn't have to worry too much about the Phoenixes or the eggs, but kill them when you get a chance.  It can actually be useful to have a Phoenix / Egg on hand at the end of stage 1, so you can Drain Life for a free heal up while KT is doing all of his theatrics.  \n\nGood luck!", "date": "2013-06-09T20:44:54-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 16384, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Your phase 1 strategy is what makes this fight trivial.

Some key things:\n\n1) Always, ALWAYS nuke Capernican first in the 4v1 stage. Without her disorienting you, there is very little chance of getting chain CC. As ret, with the t15 4 set, I find managing to open with exo and hitting Templar's Verdict is absolutely great in bringing her down rapidly.\n\n2) If your class has a damage absorb bubble - Use it before they aggro. Sacred Shield alone absorbs a LOT of damage, it may make the difference between wiping and winning.\n\n3) The stun debuff, you just gotta live with. It can be dealt with. Nuke the mage. Any class that relies on spells for a chunk of it's dps (read: Most of you reading this) should take down Thaladred next - he is the one that silences you, if I remember right.

Make way to Kael'thas Sunstrider chamber and kill the 3 small groups. Once they are dead then run up to this guy and then either get close or hit him then run our of his chamber immediately and make way to dungeon entrance. There will be 3 small chambers where there are blue crystals in each chamber. Go to the chamber closest to the dungeon entrance and wait for the first guy to appear. He walks real slow so will take a moment. Once he shows up he will toss you back so make sure you don't accidentally get thrown out of the dungeon. Once he is dead the next guy spawns from the big boss chamber and since he runs to you it will not take long to get to you. Kill him in same area and the guy you just killed. Once this second guy is dead then run to the phoenix boss chamber( very first boss you come to.) run up the ramp on right side ramp and wait for the lady caster right where the ramp meets the upped ledge. Once she shows up kill her in this upper chamber. Once she is dead the next guy spawns. You can now start heading to the big boss chamber and when you run into the hunter guy just kill him where you meet him. Once he is dead then run to big boss chamber and wait at entrance to big boss chamber. Since you ran out of the chamber a force field across this door has appeared keeping you out of the chamber. Just wait just outside of this door till the weapons show up. Kill the weapons right here just outside this door. Once all the weapons are killed then the 4 guys you killed earlier are brought back by big boss. But since you spread them out you will end up killing the hunter guy first. The trick to staying alive is too kill them before the next guy gets back to you. The lady caster will be next. she has a nasty disorient spell but work through it and kill her before the melee guy shows up next. Since this next guy runs he will show up before the last guy since the last guy walks real slow so they should not show up together. Once these guys are dead then run back to door that has the force field up to keep you out of the last chamber and wait for main boss to come through the force field and then attack him close to this door. The first time I did this I got too far from force field door and the main boss despawned and I had to do it all over again. Whne main boss spawns the fire bird kill it then go back to main boss. The main boss will run back into his chamber and the force field will still be up so just wait for him to come back out. Stay close to the force field door and use a bandage or a heal spell to get your life up if need be. The main boss will come through door again and then you can engage him. He might spawn another fire bird so kill it again.  then go back to main boss.\r\n\r\nLike I said before this is easy to do. The trick is to spread out the 4 guys to give you time to kill them again before the next guy shows up\r\n\r\nGood luck and hope this helps", "date": "2013-08-28T20:02:05-05:00", "rating": -7, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
{"commentv2": 1, "number": 292, "id": 1911872, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "JoeAlder", "body": "Friendly tips for fellow DKs:\n\nSPEC:\n\n- If you've got Frost spec and are decently geared (don't ask me what \"decent\" is, I started trying Frost at 530, and was pretty much overkill, even with tank 608 cloak), spec into it. You'll cut everyone in half with two attacks.\n\n- If you prefer Unholy, remember to dismiss your pet when Kael steps into the fight. We don't want to get MC'ed so close to victory, do we?\n\n- If all else fails, go with Blood. Survivability for the win!\n\nTALENTS:\n\n- Lichborne will help you against Sanguinar's fear. You can use it a couple seconds before he becomes active for the first time, allowing you to nuke him without interruptions. When fighting the four advisors, you can use it reactively to break a fear, or proactively when burning down someone (see tactics below) to avoid getting feared. Note that it will NOT break Kael's MC, though I'm not sure if it will prevent it. It also works as a panic button, being able to self-cast Death Coil to heal yourself.\n\n- Death's Advance will reduce your speed loss when affected by Capernian's Arcane Explosion, and will allow you to sprint back to her.\n\n- Desecrated Ground will break Sanguinar's fear and Telonicus' stun. It will only break the current, short-lasting debuff, the one-minute debuff that periodically stuns you will keep ticking.\n\nGLYPHS:\n\n- Glyph of Ice-bound Fortitude will reduce to half your IBF CD, allowing you to break out of stuns more often.\n\n- Glyph of Regenerative Magic (not to be confused with Glyph of Anti-magic Shell). Some have stated that AMS prevents the application of Capernian's Conflagration. This glyph will almost duplicate your total AMS uptime.\n\nSTRATS:\n\n- When first fighting Capernian, try to lure her near a wall, and fight her with your back against it so you don't get knocked back. You can make her move by hiding behind a statue.\u00a0\n\n- When fighting the four advisors, your first priority is Telonicus. Cast Army before they get rezzed, and put a Death and Decay on his corpse. Try to time it so he receives just a couple of ticks (DBM + practice). Switch to a DPS stance if you're on blood so you\u00a0don't gain aggro and don't attack him. If done well, one of your ghouls should get the stun debuff, giving you time to kill him before he casts it again. Pop Lichborne and AMS and burn him down.\n\n- If it turns out that AMS doesn't prevent the Disorient CC, Capernian is your top priority, and you will have to deal with Telonicus' CC as you can. Just remember to kill him before he has time to re-apply the debuff.\n\n- If you can't manage to avoid Telonicus' debuff, wait for it to drop off before you kill the last advisor. That is, unless you don't have time and Kael is about to enter the fight. If that is the case, it is better to fight him with a stun debuff than with a stun debuff AND an advisor strolling about.\n\n- Thaladred is your last priority, but if the silence annoys you, remember that PvP trinkets break all forms of CC. Last time I tried, though, it did not break Capernian's. Whether it is a bug or an intended feature, I don't know.\n\n- When your gear is high enough, you'll just Obliterate anything within your reach whenever the CC's let you do so, which is an equally valid strategy.\n\nHope this helps, happy Al'ar farming!", "date": "2013-10-25T05:34:33-05:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2013-10-25T05:54:30-05:00", 4, "JoeAlder"]}

Kill the caster (Female BElf) a little further away as she disorients for 8 seconds.\r\nPhase two AOE the weapons down, no trouble at all. Pick up [i]Staff of Disintegration[/i], you will need it. Equip this item, as it gives you immunity to Stun, Silence and Disorient effects.\r\nPhase three, kill the assistants as a group. With the staff equipped, you are immune to their effects so just get them down asap.\r\nPhase four Kael comes into the fray. He starts fireballing you, and for an obsolete raid boss he hurts alot, so keep Ice Barrier up. This is the phase where you CANNOT Mirror Image, and if you are a Frost Mage, dismiss your Water Elemental. This is imperative, as he WILL mind control you, you kill your partner and the encounter resets.\r\nPhase five he starts to float and go all super saiyan. This is a great opportunity to re-equip your actual weapon, as in this phase it is just burn. I killed him too fast in this phase to see if he disorients, but I don't think he does. As a LV90, it should be easy enough anyway. He throws you around a little and distorts gravity, but it isn't hard once you get here.\r\n\r\nTLDR, when you kill all four assistants, dismiss Water Elemental and never use Mirror Image. Equip the Staff after the weapons are spawned and keep it equipped until he starts floating in the air.\r\n\r\nGood luck with the Mount, happy hunting!", "date": "2014-06-22T23:46:31-05:00", "rating": 6, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the tips.

My iLvl was 484. I currently have both trinkets and daggers from the heroics you can run. Those have been upgraded to 471. After many failed attempts it comes down to being able to drop Capernian before too long. As a Rogue I was able to get 2 Mutilates off before she Disoriented me. After the disorientation wears off, you need to land Rupture at 4 combo points. If this is done successfully, you should have her dead between Rupture and Deadly Poison ticks. I would also recommend positioning yourself so that if she manages to do Arcane explosion, you do not fly far away. Try to get her to engage you in the corner by a door.

It does a hellfire type effect while moving. It should be aggro'd and kited by someone with range while killing it. The Phoenix explodes on death, stay away. Once it dies it leaves an egg behind, kill that asap.\n\nWhen Kael reaches 50% he cast a spell called Gravity Lapse. A beam will lift and stay on each party member causing small but steady amounts of damage. A healer with HoT's is best for this. He also spawns arcane orbs which slowly follow people around. If you get too close to them they do a large amount of damage to you. You can continue to damage him during this time in the air. If you go and walk on the ground you will be punted back into the air and not be able to move for a couple of seconds.

Here are some pointers, until a more detailed guide is posted by someone... \n\nPhase 1 -- Standard boss-tanking scenario, though he really doesn't hit very hard. A phoenix will spawn, which procs a steady Hellfire (like the fire elementals in Mech, though without the fire trail) and slowly goes straight for the healer. Have ranged DPS take it down (and slow it, if possible) immediately while tank sticks to boss. Melee DPS should probably stay on boss too, since the Hellfire is pretty damaging. After it explodes upon death (don't be near that!), an Egg will spawn, which should be destroyed to avoid a respawn (it is a phoenix!). Also of note, the Boss will randomly target someone (seems like it was the tank most of the time) with an AoE spell -- simply move out of it, or you'll die. It's hard to miss -- bright orange/pink aura with rotating spheres.\n\nPhase 2a -- At 50% health, Boss \"turns the world upside down\" (Gravity Lapse). This throws everyone up into the air, applies a steady arcane DoT, and spawns large pink bubbles that result in large damage if you run into them. (It is a good idea to make sure you've killed all Phoenix and Eggs before you DPS him down to 50%, so those guys won't be in the way, though the phoenix do stay on the ground.) You can swim through this stuff like it is water, only at normal movement speed. Have ranged DPS continue to burn the Boss, but mainly, survive and heal is the most important thing to do here. Long casting spells are not ideal, due to the interruption from the DoT. Everyone else simply move around to avoid bubbles and whoever can, apply heals, especially HoT or any instant spells. Do NOT tank boss during this 10-15 second period and do NOT touch the ground! It will throw you up into the air and stun you, at which point you're likely to fall to your death when he stops the Gravity Lapse. \n\nPhase 2b -- This is a period of perhaps 10 seconds, where the boss is stunned and prone to 150% damage. DPS the hell out of him, everyone! Druid tanks, go cat to help DPS him, since he doesn't fight back. If he's still alive after this, he goes back to Phase 2a...wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nWe wiped several times. It takes practice.

If you have a warlock in the group, get him to put Soulstone on the main tank.\r\n\r\nWhen battle is engaged, Kael'thas will start casting fireballs at the player with the highest aggro, the tank. It can be interrupted and should be to minimise heals required.\r\n\r\nA phoenix will spawn shortly after, you will need to get a range class to DPS it heavily to kite the phoenix while slowing it with any slow abilities. After the range class grabs aggro, he kites it around while the group starts to DPS the phoenix down, when it turns into an egg, kill it off.\r\n\r\nIf you have a druid and priest, get them to cast HoTs on every target frequently because the next part requires heavy healing. If you have a resto shaman, get everyone to stack up before gravity lapse for chain heals, paladin can cast divine shield to lessen heals required.\r\n\r\nAt around 60%, Kael'thas will activate a shield that has 10k hitpoints and reflects partial damage, doing so, he will begin casting pyroblast. There are multiple strategies to counter this but the straight forward method is to take down the shield with very heavy DPS (About 700 per person), if you feel that he is going to activate his pyro combo soon, get party to load up their bursts and interrupt the pyroblast immediately when the shield is down. Another strategy is to either Divine Shield/ Blessing of Forberence through the pyroblast if you are a prot paladin tank. You can also resurrect back up with Soulstone and rebirth after the Pyro hits. [b]The pyroblast cannot be reflected[/b].\r\n\r\nKael'thas will put you into gravity lapse mode pulling everyone to him, 3 orbs will spawn and follow a player, the party will start taking 300 damage periodically. All you have to do is distance yourself as far as possible away from the orbs and start hitting Kael'thas. When the lapse is over, he will drop you to the ground, you will have a split second to do double DPS on him while he is powerless before he starts to cast gravity lapse again.\r\n\r\nKael'thas will eventually die, you can enjoy your drops now.\r\n\r\n[u]TL;DR version[/u]\r\n\r\n-Interrupt fireballs\r\n-Kite phoenix around and kill it\r\n-HoTs on everyone frequently, same with chain heals\r\n-DPS shield down and interrupt his pyro/ Divine Shield/ Blessing of Forberence through the pyro/ SS or Rebirth through it\r\n-Dodge the orbs in gravity lapse, DPS at max distance", "date": "2008-03-27T00:48:12-05:00", "rating": 25, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "If you have a priest, make sure to cast renews and Prayer of Mendings, as they will more than make up for the damage taken while flying around.", "creationdate": "2008-05-02T01:40:48-05:00", "id": 32505, "rating": 7, "commentid": 260723, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "exShinra", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Patch 2.4.3: \"Vexallus and Kael'thas are now tauntable in Heroic mode.\"", "creationdate": "2008-06-26T11:43:18-05:00", "id": 339473, "rating": 2, "commentid": 260723, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "117826", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "It should be noted that there are a lot more than just 3 orbs during gravity lapse, and you have longer than just \"a split second\" to dps him between gravity lapses.", "creationdate": "2008-07-15T12:29:45-05:00", "id": 341596, "rating": 3, "commentid": 260723, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "TaliaMokani", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "The only trouble you should ever have is phase 1.

Then move to the back, repeating damage, then to the other side of the room. Always staying ahead of the orbs.

As soon as Kael casts Gravity Lapse, 'swim' to the room's entrance, and while doing so throw your instant DoTs. Once there, while you wait for the orbs, cast Unstable Affliction and start to Drain Life. When the orbs get close, swim to one side of the room and then to the back, and then to the other side of the room, and then back to the entrance (while renewing your dots). At each of these four points (entrance, left side, back, right side), be sure to Drain Life (so that Kael's dot doesn't kill you).\nUse Dark Pact to recover mana, and if you really need to: use your Potion (yes the potion first), and if you need again use the Healthstone (that way you're be able to heal a 3rd time if the potion's cooldown is already gone. When Kael stops the Gravity Lapse, trinket and start casting Shadow Bolts, and be sure to renew your DoTs, but always keeping an eye on your mana and health (if you need health, Drain Life instead; for mana, Dark Pact)\nThis doesn't require \"great\" gear, but just good strategy and be able to keep an eye on your health to not be killed by Kael's DoT.", "date": "2008-03-29T19:10:26-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2008-04-04T23:14:22-05:00", 1, "89228"]}

I've found that if your DPS is really good you wont even see the pyroblast in heroic. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways that I have found that works with this boss:\r\n\r\n1. If your DPS is subpar, it is worth stopping dps 60% and wait for the second phoenix, kill it... kill the egg... then drop him below 50%. You don't want to be in the air when the second phoenix is up, it just becomes another thing to dodge and screws you up when you get the free dps time after the gravity lapse.\r\n\r\n2.

The gravity lapses are survival times, not damage times. After the gravity lapse completes he goes into a weakened state and cannot attack back for a few seconds. At this point DPS should be full tilt.\r\n\r\nFire resistance is good, but don't gear for it, its only about 4-5k damage every few seconds and a tank should easily have enough HP to take that if you are this far into the instance.

As prot the instance was overall pretty easy (I did die on my first Vexallus attempt as I forget to wait until Forebearance had faded to start, and thus couldn't remove the high stack of arcane charges), but upon reaching KT it was evident that his high magical damage was far too much for my SoL/JoL to counter.\n\nI'm usually holy, so I decided to go back to holy and see how that went, with a \"heal through it\" approach rather than \"survive it\" approach. However, failure resulted from a lack of HP, survivability talents and dps.\n\nDecided to give it one last shot as ret - with success. Due to the level difference a fair amount of the fireballs miss, and the extra damage is incredibly helpful. Two phoenixes spawned - upon spawning I opened with a judgement from range, kited for a few secs, than ran in and burst them down with CS, DS and HoW. The eggs die in 1-2 melee swings. KT actually got off a Pyroblast - as I wasn't expecting it I didn't want to risk the shield not going down, so I simply bubbled through it. Probably had about ~15 secs left before a second Pyro would've occured, which would've been a very hairy moment.\n\nAs it always has been, the gravity phase was a joke playing it safe. Used the aerial time to heal, and the ground time to knock his socks off.\n\nAnd of course, after all those respecs neither the pet nor the mount dropped. However, I'm pretty content in knowing that the only pre-Wrath dropped mounts I can't solo now are Anzu (GG druid required) and Al'ar.\n\nEdit: I should also note that I used Seal of Command (for a fight where you have the potential to take such high damage from Fireballs you can't really risk the recoil from SoB), Judgement of Light (manas not nearly as much of an issue as survivability), Blessing of Might (over kings - the extra survivability is too insignificant compared to the lost AP) and Ret Aura (in retrospect FR Aura may have been better - at the time I figured I needed the dps to ensure I pushed KT to phase 2 early enough). My ret set consists of 4/5 T7.5, 1/5 T7 (the helm - too cheap to buy the Titansteel helm for my offset), and a few random Naxx 10/25 pieces - nowhere near BIS, but it'd earn a regular spot in most guilds.", "date": "2009-03-15T15:51:55-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7HQ1n_lsU  Video of how a ret paladin can do it.", "creationdate": "2009-03-20T00:03:54-05:00", "id": 395011, "rating": 1, "commentid": 643435, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "jaxsonbateman", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-03-15T15:55:35-05:00", 1, "jaxsonbateman"]}

And it was awesome!\r\nBut then, one day in october they came.\r\nJacklanterns, ghosts, skelletons... Oh my! In my haste I ran away, while my fairy princess summoners stayed to fight the battle! But the halloween horrors overcame. And SWISH! SQUASH! Scary things happened! The beasts batteled long and hard. My bretheren sacrificed themselves for the fountain, even they can not overcome the halloween horrors they were. They took over the fountain and relinquished all of my hard work... It was sad and all was lost.\r\nAs for me... well, I ran away. But I told my elven friends: \"Let us rejoice by going to the next town over and having a huge party!\" And we did. So we walked. FAR. About a million miles or two! Through a partet ocean with only nacho bread to cure our hunger. It was really far! But as we neared the end, my people faltered and wanted to end the long tow. I told them I must leave, to find my true place within the world. I leaved with a tear in my eye.\r\nBut not long after, batteling HUMUNGUS... things, I found Illidan, my bestest and only good time friend! Besides Mr. Fluffykins. Illidan exepted me into his clan, but suggested that I go and create my own caste and leave him to his own deeds. There I could channel all the fairy energies into one place. And also have a enourmous place to put all of my dolls. And have what I've always wanted: A pet bird! It was cool!\r\nSo after a long time the energies allowed me to travel into an interdemensional world, filled with dinosaurs and crackers! But I EXPLODED... and I died. Or so they say, exept for some reason I actually didn't die, it was more like a spirit or something... I-I don't really understand how that works.\r\nAnyway, for my spirit lived on and I perseded to return once again to my fountain of youth and splender, where the fairys would once again come to my aid and the aid of my bretheren... but me moreover.\r\nAnd so it began again. As my hunt for fairyblood became inevitable, my hunger for magic and all things fun and happy bacame unabaited.\r\nAs for me... well, I look like a mess. But I was preaty happy. For once again my Pool of Awesome has returned! And I could finally summon the fairy demon godess, he-who-must-not-be-named. He would bring me my power and make me The King of Awesome!

I went with tanking gear, although some of that includes my dps gear (agi gems), since I don't tank for raids (it's a raid/heroic solo farming spec).\r\n\r\nTook me quite a few attempts to get this down.  I also searched on google and found this [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m4jUbE0x50&feature=player_embedded]video [/url]that helps at least give an idea as to what to do when the arcane bubbles apepar.\r\n\r\nWorth noting, Kael's fireball was hitting me for around 5k (says it's fire, but I wasn't resisting it, and tried additional resist gear to no effect).  So you need to burn him to 50%.  In addition to burning him to stop him from doing heavy damage, you can also out dps his pyroblast.  If you didn't berserk the phoenix, berserk attack him when he starts pyroblasting so you can get through his shield and bash.\r\n\r\nStart in cat form.  Get savage roar up, then rip asap.  Personally, once he summons the phoenix, I like to rip again.  Then go bear form, pop enrage, frenzy regen, survival instincts, and berserk - go to town.  Your maul (if glyphed) and berserk will hit the phoenix, then will hit his egg after he dies.  The point of berserking here - in addition to hitting two targets - is to get him to 50% asap.  When done this way, I haven't had to deal with a pyroblast. \r\n\r\nAt 50%, phase 2 (anti-gravity), you're likely to be hurting quite a bit (I generally am) - so I head to the back of the room (as seen in the video) and heal myself along the way.  I tend to blow a lot of mana doing this, so I innervate just in case.  (Sidenote, I'm talented to spend minimal mana on shifting).\r\n\r\nOnce he switches to the anti-gravity, the fight is yours.  He will no longer fireball or flamestrike.  There is damage per tick, but it's minimal.  Go cat, and once you have the bubbles lured away, maneuver toward Kael and feral charge - then hop up off the ground (lest it throw you up).\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2009-05-24T23:28:57-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-05-25T18:17:15-05:00", 3, "nomadicdruid"]}

Worst case he will just spam fireballs and wipe you, no matter how good your gear is. Resi gear isnt working aswell, on fireballs and pyroblasts.\r\n\r\nI got annoyed by the daily RNG, so i did the following:\r\n\r\n- Kill the first three bosses (obvious)\r\n- Kill the trashpack in Kaels room\r\n- Run back to the third boss and look out for a mob called \"Sunblade Mage Guard\" http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=24683\r\n\r\nThe mob has an interesting ability called Magic Dampening Field http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=44475#comments and he casts it pretty frequently. \r\nWhat i did was pulling one Mage Guard all the way to Kaelthas and let him cast that shield on me, resulting in\r\n\r\n- Fireballs doing 800-1000 damage instead of the usual 5000\r\n- Pyroblast did only 14.000 instead of 55.000\r\n- Phoenix did close to no damage at all\r\n\r\nmaking the fight a complete cakewalk for any feral druid attempting this fight (guess for other classes aswell, but especially for druids since we dont have anti magic shell or bubbles)\r\n\r\nHow to do the pull:\r\n\r\nSince the mobgroups change from instance to instance, it can be hard to find a Mageguard close to Kaels room. What you can do is to reset the heroic and hope that one of the 2 mob groups contain a mage guard, or leave one of the 4 mob-packs alive, then use shadowmeld if you are a nightelf, get yourself into position and use entangling roots. Now run all the way back to Kaelthas and wait for the mage guard. (If you grab a mage guard not close to Kaels room, remember to clear all packs that could be aggrod in the process).\r\n\r\nCharge Kael  as soon as the Guard is in 20-30y range.

Spell reflects account for a bit of dps, and remember that heroic throw will interrupt as well.\n\n-bloodthirst on cooldown, didn't bother with TC or demo, just keep up your main bloodthirst/dps rotation. \n\n-he WILL cast the 40k pyro twice (i'm not sure how long it takes between cast 1 and cast 2) so you need to make sure that you get him to 50% before he has a chance to cast it again.\n\n-ignore the phoenix, it will destroy itself. go after the egg whenever its up. as per usual, its imperative that there is no phoenix up going into P2.\n\n-after the pyro, last stand+trinket+enraged regen to get back up. don't pot unless you absolutely have to.\n\n-when you get to P2, you will not be near full health, so what I did was pot and then run away from the orbs. if you have any arcane resist (i had the +45 ArR violet badge plus drums of the wild) and the AoE ticks were only hitting for ~40. Once the first gravity lapse was over, i bandaged up and then started up with the bloodthirst rotation, always pulling the orbs as far away so i could get all three swings from bloodthirst on him. \n\n-if you survive the first gravity lapse to bandage you should be set, just again avoid the orbs and bloodthirst when you can.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n-resistances are key, get some FR and a bit of ArR\n-reflect/interrupt casts\n-shield wall for pyroblast, and he WILL cast it twice if you don't dps him down \n-make sure no phoenix or egg going into p2\n-save pot CD for start of p2 so you can last through the first gravity lapse and bandage once youre on the ground\n-gravity lapse damage is a joke with a bit of ArR, but orbs will still own you, so just swim to door and wait out the lapse\n-you can switch out your shield for a 2H for p2, shield wall should still be on CD\n-p2 will take a while, but slow and steady is better, and you'll probably get another enraged regen if you need it\n\nhappy albino chocobo hunting!", "date": "2009-10-18T01:48:32-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I thought I should add to this, seeing as the unwashed hordes of prot paladins, death knights and feral druids think that bragging about their solo kills ages after it's proven to be soloable by their class helps this site in any way.

Continue dpsing, use preparation and again Evasion+CoS when he finished chanelling the orb. GG.\n\nSleath up to the 2nd boss. Spec to the 1st build.

The idea is simple - gather 2-3 buffs from Pure Energy and then burst him down using Killing Spree and CoS to protect yourself at the last seconds of fight.
