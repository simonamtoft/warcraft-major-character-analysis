{"commentv2": 1, "number": 5, "id": 723380, "nreplies": 3, "sticky": 0, "user": "369598", "body": "Actually that's no spoiler no cheat nor a reference to something else.\r\nAlexandros Mograine was a member of Knights of The Silver Hand and after the fall of Lordareon and the death of Uther The Lightbringer he and Dathroan took command of that faction. During a mission to Stratholme Dathroan was slayed by demons and his body was stolen by the dreadlord Nathrezim Ballnazar of The Burning Legion and the son of Mograine, Darion who also participated in the mission was hurt. So Dathroan wanted to kill Mograine and destroy the Knights of The Silver Hand from the inside. Dathroan would achieve that by using his other son, Renault Mograine who was thought to be a less valiant warrior than Darion by his father. So Renault chose to do what Dathroan said and kill his father.\r\nSo Alexandros with High Inquisitor Fairbanks and High General Abendis (the woman) had gone on a mission to spy The Forsaken who had recently taken control of the Lordareon capital and Darion had gone to Tyr's Hand with High General Abendis ( the man) to make an alliance with the men there. It was the time that Dathroan and Renault got their plan started. Renault met with Mograine and Fairbanks in the current Scarlet Monastery and told them that Darion was caught prisoner in Stratholme while Dathroan made a deal with The Scourge to ambush Mograine there. Mograine was ambushed and had to fight with thousands of Undead with help his sword, The Ashbringer. Mograine and Fairbanks killed them all but in the end Renault slain him The Ashbringer in front of Fairbank's eyes and left.\r\nSo Dathroan (or Ballnazar if you prefer) had finally full authority in his hands and created a new order, The Scarlet Crusade. It was an order created by members of The Knights of The Silver Hand who had lost the ways of the light and had become zealots. Their commander was Renault of course. Maxwell Tirosous, the leader of The Argent Dawn refused to join The Scarlet Crusade and created the Argent Dawn.\r\nMeanwhile, Darion who had learnt about his father's death had gone to Brill to stay alone for a while. There he met Zabra Hex, a Darkspear Troll who was saved by Mograine in the past. Zabra told him that he could feel that his father was not dead but his spirit had been weakened. Darion asked him whether he knew where he could find him and the answer was: he is one a necropoli floating over Stratholme (Naxxramas). It was true, Mograin's remains had been captured by Kel'Thuzad and was transformed into a Death Knight.\r\nSo Darion joined the Argent Dawn and organised a mini invasion to Naxxramas. He also learnt that Fairbanks had returned to Scarlet Monastery and had said that he saw Renault killing Alexandros. Of course nobody believed him.\r\nSo Darion invaded Naxx and met his father in battle. He killed him and his spirit went into The Ashbringer. Alexandros' corrupted spirit told him to go to SM. He went there and Alexandros appeared and killed Renault and everyone else in the Monastery. That's the spoiler: how does Renault live? The expalnetion: he was ressurected by High Inquisitor Whitemane. Spoilerrrr! Anyway Darion saw the dead Fairbanks who was also ressurected by Whitemane later telling him to meet with Tirion Fordring. Darion met with Tirion and told him what had happened to Alexandros. He thought of it and told him that only an act of love would free Alexandros' soul.\r\nDarion returned to Light's Hope Chapel, the Argent Dawn's hq.\r\nThe next day he took part in The Battle for Light's Hope Chapel. The Scourge had gone there to necrorevive the dead who were hidden in there. During the battle Darion killed himself to cause the wrath of the sleeping souls to explode and destroy the Undead. With that act he freed his father's soul (sorry guys can't explain that part'cause I, myself haven't understood it) anyway he became a DK.\r\nAll that is described in the comic series WoW: Ashbringer.
