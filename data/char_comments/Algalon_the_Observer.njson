There's Cosmic Smash, which targets someone in the raid and launches a meteor at their position, which you must avoid due to its massive AOE damage.  And there is Big Bang, upon the casting of which it seems that everyone must get in a Black Hole and go through the portal. There are adds called Dark Matter on the other side, so people need to be at least reasonably good on health.\n\nLooks like a fun fight. Can't wait :)\n\nEDIT: Okay, after watching the healer POV video from UK I noticed a few things I'd missed before.\n\nFirstly: The polyhedrons are targetable. They're called Living Constellations. They were not DPS'd at any point in the video. However, when they collide with a Black Hole, they destroy both themselves and the Black Hole, so it is likely that one deliberately kites them into Black Holes to reduce the raid damage.\n\nSecondly: Algalon Phase Punches on a 15 second cooldown. This is a massive attack that will phase out the tank after 45 seconds (4 punches). The tank comes back soon after being phased out, but Algalon is free until then, so an offtank is crucial.\n\nThirdly: At 20%, one Enraged Dark Matter add will spawn out of every Black Hole currently up. This will happen every thirty seconds from that point forward.\n\nFourthly: Collapsing Stars AOE upon being destroyed and turning into Black Holes. This damage hits the entire raid, which is why they must be killed - they do damage to themselves (hence the name \"Collapsing\") and without focused dps they will all explode at once and wipe the raid.\n\nFifthly: The fight ends not at zero percent, but at around 250k HP (on 10 man) - about two and a half percent.\n\nIf anyone saw anything I missed, please correct me.", "date": "2009-05-27T00:03:50-05:00", "rating": 33, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Ensidia has finally released their 25-man Algalon video. http://www.ensidia.com/home/news/ensidia-vs-algalon-movie.html", "creationdate": "2009-06-08T01:34:05-05:00", "id": 102564, "rating": 18, "commentid": 728694, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "224296", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "damn, they just got him as he enraged :P that guy looks tough as hell, hitting for a decent amount at a quick pace and is prolly worth the achievement titles \"Starcaller ____\" on normal and \"____ the astral walker\" on heroic\"", "creationdate": "2009-06-09T19:26:59-05:00", "id": 410103, "rating": 1, "commentid": 728694, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "297026", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "I'm fairly certain Ensidia used an exploit to get their world first,  and then reported it to get it fixed so nobody else could do it... they're kinda famous for doing that...", "creationdate": "2009-07-01T14:05:12-05:00", "id": 413540, "rating": 1, "commentid": 728694, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "tim2098", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "nice, and from the looks of it no deaths, but idk", "creationdate": "2009-09-07T11:33:31-05:00", "id": 423786, "rating": 4, "commentid": 728694, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "436033", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "I could hear him say \"I do what I must\" once, and that is a \"Slay-quote\", so apperently someone died, but great job anyways.", "creationdate": "2010-06-18T05:07:17-05:00", "id": 168608, "rating": 6, "commentid": 728694, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "387878", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-05-28T08:54:45-05:00", 5, "TheAmadaun"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 10, "id": 732123, "nreplies": 2, "sticky": 0, "user": "Herbhaven", "body": "I decided to compose a strategy for 10-man Algalon based solely off videos. If anyone feel that things need adding, feel free to reply to this.\n\n[b]Algalon's Abilities:[/b]\n[ul]\n[li]Quantum Strike - Deals 15,675 to 17,325 Physical damage to the current tank. Algalon uses this all the time with roughly 3 second intervals so healers need to keep the tank topped up at all times. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]Phase Punch - Deals 8,788 to 10,212 Arcane damage to the current tank. When the tank gets hit by this, he will receive a debuff that will cause him to 'phase out' and lasts 45 seconds. Once the tank gets 5 stacks of this debuff, he phases and Algalon will completely ignore him for the duration of the phase shift (which is roughly 10 seconds long). This seems to be cast once every 15 seconds and can not be avoided by any means.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]Cosmic Smash - Algalon summons a red column (similar to the Shadow Fissures in the Kel'Thuzad fight) on a random player. After roughly 4 seconds, a meteor crashes down on the spot, dealing 41,438 to 43,562 Fire damage to anyone still standing in the red column. This also causes some splash damage which seems to be based off player distance from the fissure once the meteor hits.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]Big Bang - Every 90 seconds, Algalon will begin casting this 8-second spell. Once cast, everyone takes 76,313 to 88,687 Physical damage. The method to avoid this will be described later.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]Ascend to the Heavens - Deals an insane amount of damage to the entire raid. Algalon uses this after 8 minutes in combat as a form of 'Berserk', guaranteeing a wipe.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[b]During the fight, there are also several kinds of adds that are summoned:[/b]\n[ul]\n[li]Collapsing Star - Algalon summons four of these 15 seconds after initial aggro and summons more throughout the fight. These are bright balls of light that don't do anything but wander around, but lose 1% of their maximum health every second. When they die, they explode dealing 16,088 to 16,912 Shadow damage to the entire raid and leaving a Black Hole behind.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]Living Constellation - About every 50 seconds, Algalon summons three Living Constellations. These cast an Arcane Barrage-like spell that deals roughly 3-4,500 Arcane damage to a random player every few seconds. They have normal threat tables and can also be damaged, but they can be killed instantly by being kited into a Black Hole. They are also stunnable.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul]\n[li]Dark Matter - These are located inside Black Holes. They only have a basic melee attack but hit quite hard (2,500 on a Hunter). They are merely a nuisance and should be avoided. These also spawn from Black Holes once Algalon hits 20%.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[b]Anyway, onto the guide:[/b]\n\nAlgalon only has two phases, but a lot happens during these phases that the raid needs to keep alert for throughout the fight.\n\n[b][u]Phase 1[/u][/b]\nAlgalon will transform the arena into space and immediately begin attacking whoever has highest threat. Algalon hits very hard and fast and will cast Quantum Strike very often on the tank so healers need to make sure he remains at full health at all times. All DPS merely attack the boss the best they can. Algalon can be positioned anywhere as he has no frontal cleave or cone attacks.\n\nAfter 15 seconds, Algalon will use Phase Punch on the current tank every minute and summon four Collapsing Stars. Once the tank gets 5 stacks of the Phase Punch debuff, Algalon will switch to the second-highest on his threat table, so your off-tank should be ready to taunt and your healers should be ready to change targets as the off-tank will be taking a lot of damage very quickly. Algalon will be Phase Punching the tanks throughout the fight and need to keep switching.\n\nFor the stars, 1-2 DPS should be assigned to killing the stars one at a time. If they are left alone, they will all explode at the same time and wipe the raid. DPS need to make sure healers are ready before a Star is killed as the entire raid will take roughly 16k damage, and if the tank is too low on health when a Star explodes, he'll die and will very likely cause a wipe. After each star is killed, a Black Hole is left behind (explained later). Stars will keep spawning throughout the fight until Phase 3 and should always be killed.\n\nEvery 25 seconds, Algalon will begin casting Cosmic Smash on a random player. A red fissure will appear that everyone has to quickly move away from or they will die instantly. After the Cosmic Smash hits the spot, it will cause some splash Fire damage which seems to be based off the player distance with the impact point.\n\n50 seconds after the initial pull, Algalon will summon three Living Constellations that will damage random players in the raid and have normal threat tables. When a Living Constellation enters a Black Hole, it dies instantly and the Black Hole disappears. A single DPS or probably a healer should get aggro on all three of these and run behind any Black Holes they find. The idea is to kite the Constellations into the Black Hole to kill them instantly. Death Knights are an ideal choice for this as they can stand behind Black Holes and use Death Grip so the Constellations land in the hole.\n\nEvery 90 seconds from the initial pull, Algalon will begin casting a 8-second cast spell called Big Bang that is almost guaranteed to kill anyone it hits. To dodge this, everyone needs to enter a Black Hole created by a killed Collapsing Star. Once inside the Black Hole, players will take roughly 1,500 Shadow damage per second and there will be elite adds called Dark Matter scattered everywhere. Players need to avoid getting hit by these the best they can until Algalon has finished casting Big Bang. Afterwards, everyone is teleported out of the Black Hole and the fight progresses as before. Not sure of this, but each Black Hole seems to have their own separate 'realm' so players need to make sure they enter the same one if possible. Entering a Black Hole also resets all threat of the player, so it is advised the currently Phase Punched tank to stay outside and eat the Big Bang. This way, the off-tank can taunt to gain all the threat he had and DPS don't have to worry about getting aggro.\n\nThis phase continues until Algalon reaches 20%.\n\n[b][u]Phase 2[/u][/b]\nOnce Algalon reaches 20%, Collapsing Stars and Living Constellations will despawn and will no longer spawn anymore. Any currently open Black Holes will also dissapear. Algalon will continue to cast Quantum Strike, Phase Punch and Cosmic Smash however.\n\nAlgalon will then summon four Black Holes in a square pattern. Every 30 seconds, four Unleashed Dark Matters will spawn, one from each Black Hole. The off-tank needs to pick these up and tank them to the side for the rest of the fight and DPS need to burn down Algalon before these adds pile up and become too much to handle.\n\nWhen this phase begins, swap tanks as the current tank will very likely have the Phase Punch debuff and the off-tank will have a hard time surviving if he has to tank the adds and Algalon together. If you swap once the Black Holes spawn, you'll be given about 45 seconds to defeat Algalon before a forced tank-swap which should be long enough. Players also need to keep alert about Cosmic Smashes as Algalon will still be using this.\n\nOnce Algalon reaches 1-2%, everything despawns and you win![ul]\n[li][/li]\n[/ul]", "date": "2009-05-30T12:21:59-05:00", "rating": 110, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Great job, and thanks for putting in my changes.

I ran with a group of people from another guild on my realm (US-Zul'jin) in my 10-man all through Ulduar (I only run 10-mans pretty much) and we conquered hard modes fast with the exception of Firefighter.  We spent incredible amounts of time on Firefighter - something in the range of 100-150 wipes - and sadly never beat him before the late June nerfs.\n\nWhen we got to this guy after finally beating Firefighter it was like euphoria.  The art, actually the overall aesthetics of the fight, combined with his perfect voice-acting before, throughout, and after just completely blow any fight out of the water.  I didn't even care that I, a Warrior tank, was getting torn to shreds by his pure damage output, it was just amazing to be there.  I proudly wore my Starcaller title for several months, only finally replacing it in October when my guild got Herald of the Titans.  \n\nThis guy is far and away the most epic experience you'll ever have in World of Warcraft, and I highly recommend everyone to go back and see him at least once before they quit the game - I promise you that you won't regret it, or else you can personally log on Zul'jin and find me and curse me out.  Best boss ever, and I'm really sad that he's not worth much anymore with two tiers of gear beyond him released, outside of the fun and epicness factor.\n\nTips for anyone looking to fight him: \n[ol]\n[li]Have your tanks stock up on Indestructible Potions; his damage output is still no joke even rocking 10k+ more health than I had the first time we hit him.[/li]\n[li]Bring a Holy Paladin and a Discipline Priest; the bomb heals from the Paladin combined with the Shields from the Priest are the best cushion you can have on this fight.  It's light years ahead of any other combination you can bring for tank healing.[/li]\n[li]Use your most trusted ranged DPSer for stars, regardless of class.  Don't default to a hunter because other guilds do that; we use an Elemental Shaman, and it's more of a player art than a class art to kill them properly.[/li]\n[li]Have fun!

You have 6 minutes to beat this boss and burn over 8 million health, which isn't too much, but you can't slack on your DPS. Make sure you have the Sprit Bond talent as well as glyph of animal bond, and glyph of Misdirect. I'd also recommend glyph of mending and revive pet as well. \r\n\r\nIn P1 you need to watch out for cosmic smash (red firey circle that spawns under your feet) and not stand in it or you'll be thrown high up into the air. If you are an engineer you can goblin glide/parachute down, but as a hunter, you can also just disengage right before you hit the ground or even a bit earlier to negate the fall damage. You should try to ignore the adds as much as possible, but if one of the collapsing stars dies and leaves a black hole, whatever you do, DO NOT go into one, or there will be no one fighting Algalon and he will one-shot you with Ascend to the Heavens. He will also cast Big Bang after a little bit, but just deterrence this off as it's not that much damage. (With 30% deterrence I got hit for ~57K) When living constellations come out, if they agro you just feign death and let your pet tank them. \r\n\r\nThe hardest part of the solo is when he gets to about 20-30% (I'm not exactly sure when this happens as this is the first time I've ever seen him use this mechanic, but it only happens towards the very end of the fight.) he will have a bunch of dark matter adds come out of any black holes you have up. Don't let this part confuse you, as it kind of looks like your inside the black hole area except Algalon is with you, but you are still outside. (I got confused on the first few attempts by this myself) Try to just feign death here and then AoE them down when they get to your pet as they have really low HP, then get back to Algalon. This is the hardest part of the fight due to there being so many things that can damage you and you should use as many DPS CDs as possible to finish this phase quickly. \r\n\r\nTIP: If your pet dies at any point during this fight, (which can very easily happen) pop deterrence if it's up and immediately cast revive pet to minimize the amount of damage you take while rezzing. Then feign death and let your pet continue doing it's valiant job tanking the boss. \r\n\r\n The fight ends at about 1% of his health, so good luck to all of you soloers out there! :)", "date": "2013-02-05T04:40:40-06:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Decided to play around with a few things, and I think I may have a nearly fail-proof strategy for this now, as long as you have the H/H breed of Unborn Val'kyr. (I didn\u2019t test it with a B/B, so I make no assumptions about that \u2013 try at your own discretion. It may still work.) Cosmos gave Magical Crawdad 2 nasty crits in a row right out of the gate, and it still managed to survive. I spent a LOT of time failing this battle either because of Cosmos's crit RNG on some of the previous pet strategies or because I didn't have the right pets for other strategies. It\u2019s long, but hopefully this will save someone else the RNG headache as well.\r\n\r\n**Until you get to Constellatius, pay special attention to the move order. You\u2019re going to put Renewing Mists back up before it falls off once, so that you have enough turns of it remaining to heal Unborn Val\u2019kyr when the following swap occurs. The \u201cearly\u201d Renewing Mist is not a mistake or an oversight, it\u2019s part of the strategy.\r\n\r\n***If you don\u2019t have a Snowfeather Hatchling, you can probably use any other defense-break pet that can survive the three rounds until Comet is dead. Just make sure you\u2019re using the defense-break on round 4 and 5. The Predatory Strike opener at the beginning of Cosmos is really just filler. If whatever pet you sub for Snowfeather Hatchling dies in turn 5, bring in Magical Crawdad, cast Renewing Mists in turn 6, and continue as normal when Unborn Val\u2019kyr gets swapped in in turn 7.

So here's what I ended up succeeding with:\r\n\r\nZandalari Anklerender (305/289) > 2,2,2\r\nEmerald Proto-Whelp (305/273) > 1,1,2\r\nNether Roach (210/255, mine was green/uncommon) > x,2,x (it really doesn't matter, but having Survival ensures you won't accidentally get killed if Constellatius crits)\r\n\r\nTurn 1: Primal Cry\r\nTurn 2: Black Claw\r\nTurn 3-4: Hunting Party (Zandalari Anklerender dies, bring in Emerald Proto-Whelp)\r\nTurn 5: Breath, Comet dies\r\nTurn 6-8: Emerald Dream\r\nTurn 9: Ancient Blessing\r\nTurn 10: Breath\r\nTurn: 11: Breath\r\n\r\nRepeat Turn 6 through Turn 11 until Cosmos is dead (it will take a bit to do). A word of caution: if Cosmos crits too much the Proto-Whelp may die and you'll have to restart.\r\n\r\nOnce Cosmos is dead and Constellatius enters, the rotation gets switch up a bit. Use Emerald Dream > Breath > Ancient Blessing > Breath > back to Emerald Dream and so forth. RNG will determine how long your Proto-Whelp lives, but the goal is to run out the Apocalypse countdown as much as possible. Once your Proto-Whelp dies, Nether Roach will come in.\r\n\r\nYou can pass every turn or use a damage ability to stay busy. Once my Nether Roach got down to sub-600 health, I used Survival to make sure Constellatius didn't accidentally kill it. The next round, Apocalypse hit and I won!\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned previously, just a little bad luck with RNG can throw the whole fight but I only lost one time with this team due to some rotation screw ups, and then sailed through the second time. I'll also mention that this fight is extremely sensitive to any slight modification. At first, I used a different Zandalari dino with naturally higher speed than Comet and I couldn't get it to work due to timing of Comet's death and Cosmos' swap ability and specific rotation, so breed differences may net different results.
