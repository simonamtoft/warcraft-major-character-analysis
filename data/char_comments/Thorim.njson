The gauntlet itself is pretty simple, the only thing you need to watch out for is the big mob in the end of the first hallway, he will constantly \"explode\" the sides of the rooms which deal hefty damage if you stand on the wrong side. You can see which side will explode by looking at the mobs hands, which have fire coming out of them before the explosion comes. Careful while killing the mob too, he as a damage reflect buff. The other big mob before the end isnt much of a threat, he places a buff on one of the players fighting him which immobilizes and deals damage after a few seconds Oh, and while running to Thorim, in the last hall way, hug the sides unless you want to get stunned for ~20 seconds. Overall, its very easy and with 4 players, not a problem at all.\n\nWhile the gauntlet is done, adds will spawn in the arena where the remaining players are.

The only way is to kill him by activating his Hard Mode. Phase 1 (reaching Thorim) is the most difficult part of the fight. Voidlord should be set to passive (you command it manually). Kill all the adds in the arena, open the gate by using the lever, run into the corridor where you pull Runic Colossus (use Burning Rush and Dark Regeneration!) and quickly return to the arena (keep the big add alive). Place your Demonic Portal just past the gate, return to the arena and wait for reset. Kill all the adds in the arena except Runic Colossus and one additional mob. Teleport past the gate, resummon Voidlord and kill Runic Colossus. Keep the add from the arena alive as you kill the rest enemies on your way to Thorim. When you are near Thorim, kill the add from the arena and wait for Thorim to do his roleplay until Sif spawns. If you enter earlier, you fail... If you wait too much, you fail too... Do not bother counter of Hard Mode in the DBM, because it counts the time from the first pull, rather than the reset. When you jump down, do not forget to resummon Voidlord.

Thorim himself isn't particularly hard, as long as you pop the usual CDs such as Time Warp and Mirror Image. Getting to fight Thorim by yourself is the hard part, as the mechanics are meant to keep you from soloing him.\n\nTo override the mechanics: Kill all the starting arena mobs. Be ready to pull the lever to the gate [i]as soon as Thorim begins to speak[/i]. If you wait too long, the stormforged dwarves who begin to attack you will keep interrupting your attempts. Once you open the gate, immediately run down and around the corner toward the giant mob at the far end. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1953]Blink[/url] as soon as you round the corner, then use [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108978]Alter Time[/url] around the center of the circular room. Keep running toward the giant mob and throw an [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=131080]Ice Lance[/url] at him. If you timed it right, Alter Time will pull you back right after you pull the big mob. He should stay aggroed on you. Turn around and run back toward the gate, casting [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108843]Blazing Speed[/url] immediately. Blink should come off of cooldown once you turn the corner; use it again to get to the gate. You will need ALL of these spells to get out of the gate before the insta-kill spark reaches you. If you are missing any of these, you [i]may[/i] be able to replace it with a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=2459]Swiftness Potion[/url], but I haven't tested that.\n\nOnce you have pulled the giant mob back through the gate, resummon your Water Elemental (it should have been killed by the spark) and [i]make it STAY[/i] in the middle of the room. Also set it to passive. It must NOT kill the giant mob before the fight resets, which is indicated by the gate closing and the arena mobs respawning. [b]You MUST be inside the gate when it closes, NOT in the arena.[/b] Now you can kill the giant mob. This will open the door at the end of the hallway, allowing you to reach Thorim.\n\nFrom here, you will need to kill the arena mobs to actually restart the fight. But, since you're on the opposite side of the gate from them, you cannot pull them yourself. This is why you placed your elemental on the far side. Click on any of the mobs and have your elemental begin attacking it. Once it pulls aggro, resummoning it inside the gate next to you [i]should[/i] pull all the arena mobs through the gate to you. (This has worked every time I tried it, even when only one mob was attacked. I assume they will always all come together.) Now, kill [b]all but one[/b] of the arena mobs. Leaving the captain alive is safe, because he has the most health and you're least likely to kill him on accident. Also, [b]set your elemental to passive again[/b] so it doesn't accidentally kill the last arena mob and start the fight too early.\n\nNow you need to run to the end of the tunnel and kill the other big mob at the top of the stairs to open the second door. Do not kill the remaining arena mob until you are in the larger room where you can see Thorim.\n\nKill the arena mob. Thorim will start talking. Get close to him, [b]but not too close[/b] or he will jump down to the floor before you can aggro him, then despawn. I'm not sure exactly where the line is; there's a line between two different kinds of flooring pretty close to him, and it might be that, but you can be somewhat cautious here.\n\nThe final part is a bit tricky. Sif will appear and start talking to him. This is when Thorim becomes a \"valid target.\" Now you can attack him and jump down to the floor, actually beginning the fight. But this is also about when he will summon the giant spark of death, which appears almost exactly where you're standing. You need to know about how long his speech takes, and start running toward him right when Sif appears. Hit him with an Ice Lance as you run by, then jump down to the floor. If all goes well, you will have done some damage to him and not died yourself. That's all you need; you should be able to fight him normally now. Like I said, he's fairly easy; certainly easier than a number of the other bosses I've soloed from Ulduar and Icecrown. Good luck!\n\nThis strategy should work for any class that is both fast enough to pull the big mob at the end of the hallway, and has a way of damaging the arena mobs through the gate once they respawn.\n\n[b]TL;DR:\n- Open the gate, pull the giant mob at the end of the hall. Get out before giant spark of death kills you.\n- Pull arena mobs through gate with your elemental once fight resets. Leave one alive until you reach the room right before Thorim.\n- Kill remaining arena mob. Tag Thorim when Sif appears, then jump to the floor before giant spark of death appears.\n- Kill Thorim.[/b]", "date": "2013-08-09T21:30:27-05:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Well, not every class got a pet to stay in the arena...", "creationdate": "2014-04-26T02:13:50-05:00", "id": 742575, "rating": 1, "commentid": 1885736, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Volvic", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "I just used this method as an Elemental Shaman (no pet used since the Ele's despawn if you get too far.

I thought I'd share a couple details for other pallies:\r\n\r\nAfter you kill the initial set of arena mobs and go into the hallway, you'll need to sprint in, tag the big guy, and sprint out, as stated.  For this, I found [spell=26023] to be the talent of choice.  You will also need a [item=2459], and [spell=642].\r\n\r\nThe trick is timing Divine Shield.  Make sure you have full Holy Power after killing the last mob.  As you enter the hallway, refresh Sacred Shield.  The mobs in the hallway stun, so you need DS to get past them, but you want to rely on SS and avoidance for at least a GCD after they start attacking.  Then you pop Divine Shield.  Judge the big mob the instant you can (and make sure it goes off!), then immediately turn and hit the potion.\r\n\r\nThe reason for waiting on the potion is that otherwise, you'll be charging into mobs when the shield fades, rather than away, and also to avoid any overshoot as you're running towards the big guy.  I found that if you are off by a single step or a fraction of a second with DS, you will get stunned.\r\n\r\nFor tagging the second wave of arena mobs when the encounter resets, you will of course need Light's Hammer.  You need to aim this near the rim of that golden disc on the ground, closer to Thorim, to ensure that it hits all the mobs.  It's annoyingly easy to miss one.\r\n\r\nThen get back in the tunnel, kill the big guy, blitz the tunnel mobs, mark the Captain when the arena mobs catch up to you, and then kill them all except the Captain.  You need to kill the Captain closeish to Thorim, past the midpoint of that large tan circle in the ground before him.  The line you have to watch out for is the first row of blue bricks in the ground right before his little platform.  If you step on that last row of blue bricks, he'll jump down and reset.  If you kill the Captain too far away, Sif won't appear.  You want to be in that huge beige disc, kill the Captain, and then wait until he becomes attackable to tag him and jump down.\r\n\r\nAnd then, after a few hours, a stack of potions, and hundreds in repairs, you'll have a dagger, mail belt, and the wrong shoulders to show for it.  At least that was my magnificient haul.\r\n\r\nThis thing can bug out enough ways to really make you crazy.  Just keep at it and you will get it, it is entirely about timing.\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2013-08-27T00:10:05-05:00", "rating": 8, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "515 ret pally, able to solo with this strat (also a good video of it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljab7FUxRwU.)

Kill the adds in the arena and open the gate. (same as kp202's strat)\n2. Run in the gate far enough to trigger the fight failure and make Thorim cast the spark, then run back into the arena to avoid the spark, running back into the hallway before the gate closes while leaving my pet in the arena.

You can guarantee FoF procs by using your pet's freeze on the arena mobs.  After I killed the first giant I immediately blinked through the door as soon as it started opening, angling myself so I'd end up a little up the stairs.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 60, "id": 1965185, "nreplies": 3, "sticky": 0, "user": "Paladestar", "body": "I soloed him today as a hunter.  It was so frustrating trying to find a good guide that makes every point crystal clear, but after a lot of trial and error I was eventually able to engage Thorim.  Hopefully my findings can help others who want to solo Thorim as a hunter.\r\n\r\nI played as BM so that I could have a spirit beast pet for the self-healing.  I had ilvl 578, but really gear isn\u2019t a problem here, the only hard part is being able to actually engage Thorim.\r\n\r\nMake sure that you have the [b]Glyph of disengage[/b] and the [b]Posthaste talent[/b].  You\u2019ll also need a stack of [b]Swiftness Potions[/b] (50% speed increase for 15 seconds) or a stack of [b]Darkwater potions[/b] (70% speed increase for 15 seconds).  Either potion kind is fine, but the 70% ones will allow you a greater margin for error.\r\n\r\n1. Observe the arena as you enter; some Iron dwarves are fighting a giant Jormungar.  Pick a spot where one of the dwarves is currently standing and memorise this location by the pattern on the floor of the arena.  You\u2019ll need to place an explosive trap here later.\r\n\r\n2. Move around the left side of the arena to the steps leading down to the tunnel/gauntlet.  Turn to face the enemies in the middle of the room.  Move to the right side of the steps as you face the enemies so that the lever that will later allow you to open the gate is in range.\r\n\r\n3. Misdirect to your pet and engage the enemies in the arena.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as the last enemy dies you will be able to interact with the lever, click it to begin a ten second cast to open the gate.  While this in progress put your pet on passive if it isn\u2019t already set this way.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the gate opens disengage down the tunnel (your back should already be facing the gate due to your positioning from point number 2 above), turn the first corner and head towards the mini-boss at the end of this section of the gauntlet.\r\n\r\n6. Just before you reach the first row of dwarves cast Deterrence, this will prevent them from being able to hinder your movement.\r\n\r\n7. Just before the 60% movement speed bonus from the Posthaste talent runs out use your 50% or 70% move speed potion.\r\n\r\n8. Target the first gauntlet mini-boss as soon as you can, spam your Arcane Shot bind, so that as soon as the mini-boss is in range you\u2019ll attack it.\r\n\r\n9. As soon as you fire your arcane shot at the mini-boss turn around and run back to the arena you started in.  Disengage will come off of cooldown a couple of seconds after you fire your arcane shot so use it to help your speed if needed.  You can also use a second deterrence after you\u2019ve fired your shot at the mini-boss if you want to play it ultra-safe.\r\n\r\n10. You should easily make it back to the arena, but your pet may lag behind and die, not a big deal you can just revive it later, or if you manually activate Dash on your pet (assuming you use a spirit beast like I did) it\u2019ll catch up and get out of the gauntlet before the one-shot fight-reset lightning ball of doom catches up to it.\r\n\r\n11. Toss your explosive trap at the location you noted as indicated in point number 1 above.\r\n\r\n12. Get back inside the gauntlet before the gate closes, careful for the mini-boss\u2019s knockback, it can prevent you making it back through the gate in time.\r\n\r\n13. [b]You must not kill the mini-boss until the enemies in the main arena have respawned and the gate has closed.[/b]  When the enemies will respawn, they will trigger your explosive trap (if you placed it correctly) and start to follow you down the gauntlet as a result, they walk right through the closed gate.\r\n\r\n14. Kill the mini-boss and work your way through the gauntlet.  I didn\u2019t bother to kill any of the arena enemies at this stage, but if you have gear concerns and are worried about being overwhelmed later you can kill some of these now, just [b]make sure that at least one arena dwarf stays alive.[/b]\r\n\r\n15. Kill everything else in the gauntlet that is attackable, remembering to keep at least one arena dwarf alive.  Move into the room behind Thorim, avoid the two large circular traps on the floor.\r\n\r\n16. Once you\u2019re about half way along the room behind Thorim kill the remaining arena enemies that followed you through the gauntlet.  This will trigger a speech from Thorim.  Dismiss your pet now to play it safe, so that the silly thing doesn\u2019t get stuck when you later jump into the arena.\r\n\r\n17. This is the bit that frustrated me the most.  If you move too close to Thorim before Sif spawns he\u2019ll trigger the next phase, jump into the arena, but be unattackable, he\u2019ll then despawn and reset.  You must wait until Sif spawns before moving near him.  The problem with this is that as soon as Sif spawns Thorim will cast the one-shot lightning ball of doom and kill you.  You need perfect timing to get into the arena after Sif spawns but before the lightning orb can kill you.  I could never get it just right, too fast and Thorim remains unattackable, too slow and the lightning orb will kill you.  Then I had a nice idea, I made a macro:\r\n\r\n[code]/cast [harm] Disengage[/code]\r\n\r\nBind this macro to a key.  In the room behind Thorim note the small tiles on the floor, the trigger zone for the next phase is about 1 and a half small tiles before the start of the arch that links this room to the balcony where Thorim stands.  So to be totally safe, stand two rows of tiles from the edge of the arch, face into the room, so that the arch to the balcony is directly behind you.  [b]Target Thorim[/b] and spam the crap out of your disengage macro bind.  As soon as Sif spawns Thorim becomes attackable meeting the [harm] criteria of the macro, you\u2019ll disengage with perfect timing to not be too early or too late.  Run off the balcony as soon as you land from the disengage to make it into the arena before the lightning orb.

Mind Control. When you pull the adds from the gauntlet with you, make sure you kill the melee, and kill all but 2 of the Dark Iron Acolyte, in case you mess up. MC one, go to the far edge, and use smite on the arena dark iron dwarf (It's 6 on the action bar). Done right, it should hit the dwarf. As soon as its finished casting, jump off with the MC.
