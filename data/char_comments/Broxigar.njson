Shreds of clothes, broken pieces of furniture, rotting food, and, yes, there were bodies. Not many, thankfully, and none at this spot. Jarod had parties scanning the shore, seeking any dead so that they could have swift but proper burials. It was not just a matter of propriety, but safety, too.

It did not even feel wet. \u201cThis isn't possible,\u201d he muttered, eyeing the sea suspiciously.\n\nBut no spirit arose from the depths to give a reason for the amazing discovery. The wizard looked down at the ax, then at the sea, and lastly at the ax again.\nFinally, Rhonin stared off into the direction of the lost portal. An image of Brox standing atop slaughtered demons and challenging more to come to him filled the human's thoughts.\nThe wizard suddenly raised the ax high in what he recalled from his own time as an orcish salute to fallen heroes.\nRhonin brandished it three times, then lowered the ax head-first.\n\u201c[b]They'll sing of you yet[/b],\u201d he whispered, recalling Brox's words to both him and Krasus. \u201c[b]They'll pass songs of you down for generations to come.
