The reason I disagree is that you're implying either that Furion was at all times partly selfish, or that somehow Illidan's selflessness is somehow \"stronger\" than Furion's, which raises the question about why this would be so. You can't say that it was because Illidan suffered so much, because he brought his suffering upon himself, and at one point was even exalted, as one of the Queen's beloved Highborne.\n\n\n[i]...it was only his love for Tyrande that drove him to seek power...[/i] (quote from Dorminus)\n\n\nIn [i]The Frozen Throne[/i], this was partly the case. However, during the War of the Ancients, it most certainly was not. Illidan became the Betrayer without any desire to impress Tyrande at all, and the Night Elves paid for Illidan's short-sighted lust for power with many, many lives.\n\nYou normally get two types of heroes - the good person who defeats temptation without a moment of weakness, and the good person who fights a hard struggle to do the right thing. People today think the second type is more interesting and our cynical modern world teaches that the first kind of person doesn't exist or is ridiculously rare. So it's easy for people to 'like' Illidan because he reflects the kind of character we're supposed to 'identify' with. That says more about our modern culture than it does about human nature, since in the time of, say, Aristotle, people thought the opposite. \n\nIn Warcraft lore specifically, it isn't just what you do that makes you a hero, it's why as well. Because if you were today's hero, you can very well become tomorrow's villain if your heroics were all for the wrong reason and the story demonstrates this.\n\n[i]...When he saved Tyrande and returned her to Malfurion, he knew returning to Outland was a death sentence because Kil'jaden would find him and kill him for failing to destroy the Frozen Throne...\n[/i] (quote from Dorminus)\n\n\nI also disagree that Illidan ran off to Outland to sacrifice himself. If he'd done that out of selflessness, he wouldn't have dragged the naga and blood elves along unless he want them to die with him (lolwut?). And he wouldn't have gone to all the trouble of trying to close the Legion's portals into Outland. I think he really did plan to be Lord of Outland from the beginning: the campaign itself seemed to imply that and it's the most straightforward explanation. \n\nTLDR version: Illidan, like Ner'zhul, was a complex character with conflicting motivations and desires. A few acts of goodness - difficult as they were for him - amid a whole history of cruelty and violence really don't 'prove' that he is a \"good guy\", but they do prove that he isn't an absolute evil like Gul'dan.\n\nEDIT: Reposting an old reply that was edited way too many times.\n\nEDIT 2: Fixed a wrong italic.

I would stand beside you in battle as denizens of the horde would flood into our beloved city and I would give many lives to your perseverance against them. But then wait... you blanket them with moonfire. That druid ability, instant cast.. its a DOT. Just ask Malfurion. I know,  I know what you are going to say. 'I'm Thousands of years old and I am blessed by Elune. Having a druid ability is not a big deal.' I guess it stands to reason.  There is some precedent with it . Priests picking up a hammer and become paladins. So... yeah even though its a thin excuse I could accept this. We have been though so much for me to get caught up in that. Yikes! All the horde are now in melee range on you! How are we going to win this wh... DID YOU JUST CLEAVE THEM? You crazy elf thats a WARRIOR ABILITY. Whats your excuse for this one? Elune with her secret Canadian family was a warrior? Agh you are killing me! How can you be so uncaring and cold? That all of us Heroes must make due with our locked set of abilities as we use our blood, sweat, and tears to change Azeroth for the better and you play IDGAF with what you do? Heh... I see your smirk. I know what its for. We both know that isnt even the biggest middle finger you give. Its that you.... You freaking have the audacity to call yourself High PRIESTess of Elune. You rhymes with witch.\r\n\r\nJust kidding dear loves you. See you next thursday when all those construction guys start rebuilding all the stuff the horde broke. We are still on to sit on top of the temple in our fishing chairs drinking right?\r\nLove Ya\r\nPhylum <3\r\n\r\nP.S. when Illidan was still trying to impress you did he ever send you any... um.. interesting pictures? If so you toats need to share.

Magni, you have called this meeting.  What concerns you?[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45666]King Magni Bronzebeard[/url]: You've no doubt noticed the string of earthquakes we've had in the last weeks.  Something doesn't feel right about them.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41710]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/url]: What do you mean?[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: We dwarves have a connection to the earth.  We can feel her pain.  And right now the earth is crying out.  These earthquakes... they are both natural and not.  I wanted to gather you all together and discuss them.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45776]Tyrande Whisperwind[/url]: Even in Darnassus we have noticed the earth is at odds with something.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: I've received word from my brother Brann in Northrend.  In his exploring of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/zone=4273]Ulduar[/url] he came across some unusual tablets... something ancient.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Nothing good has come from that dreadful place.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: This might just change your mind.  Brann is shipping the tablets to me as we speak. Preliminary reports from the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Explorers'_League]Explorers' League[/url] state that they may be able to help us understand what is going on with the earthquakes.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45667]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/url]: Our top minds have been looking into the seismic activities... Well, we've mostly been looking at how to secure a building's frame while at the same time simulating tectonic shifts...[/li]\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: ...because on the one hand, this could be a handy device, the \"Shake-a-Ton 2000.\"  But on the other hand, the last thing we gnomes want to see is the mountains of Dun Morogh collapse and crush Ironforge.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: So is that why you have moved out?[/li]\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: Ha, not at all!  Though it is a striking coincidence.  Gnomeregan has been and continues to shame our people.  It is long past time we reclaim our homeland.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Well, it is good that things have turned out... better for you and your people, High Tinker.  But not all of us have the luxury of up and moving our kingdom.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45774]Prophet Velen[/url]: And those that did know how dangerous these earthquakes can be.  To this day, the Exodar is still shaking from our rather abrupt arrival.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I'm not certain we could organize our people to move even if we wanted to.  We've also received word of hostile elementals appearing randomly across the lands, sometimes in towns, sometimes across the countryside.  Moving may not be an option.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: Well, there is at least a wee bit of good news... no offense, Gelbin.  The shaking seems to have stirred up [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Earthen_Ring]The Earthen Ring[/url].  Even the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=39055]Wildhammer shaman[/url] have offered their help.[/li]\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Perhaps these events are also what have brought forth the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Highborne]Highborne[/url] from [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Shen%27dralar]Shen'dralar[/url].[/li]\n[li][b]Prophet Velen[/b]: It seems as if this world is coming apart at the seams.  I've seen these symptoms before, on Draenor... We may not be able to stop this.  Fleeing may be our best option.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Fleeing is not an option I wish to entertain at this point. We will find another way.  Perhaps these tablets from Ulduar will shed some light on our situation.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: Hopefully we can get these answers quickly.  The [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40125]people[/url] are frightened, and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40124]cultists[/url] are taking advantage of that fear.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: These cultists only exacerbate the problem.  They preach the end of the world, or that the world is having birthing pains... Hyperbole that is hard for the populace to ignore.[/li]\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Troubling times indeed. Fear of the unknown makes people do foolish things.[/li]\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: And our lack of answers only fuels the confusion.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: All the more reason we need to reach the bottom of this.  This tablet from Ulduar will lead us in the right direction.  Brann is sure of it.  And if Brann is certain, then I am certain.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I've made it a point not to argue with a dwarf when it comes to the earth.  If the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Bronzebeard_clan]Bronzebeards[/url] are sure this tablet will help solve the earth's problems, then by all means we should support them.[/li]\n[/ul][/quote]", "date": "2010-11-01T20:26:22-05:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-11-01T21:55:41-05:00", 1, "Ketho"]}
