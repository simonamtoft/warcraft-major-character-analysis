You'll want to start with the patrol of two mobs that walk in front of Kang, then kill the two ads on his right-hand, and then go for the one on his left-hand side last. You can pull all of these mobs as long as you don't pull them past him. Otherwise, Kang will aggro, and you'll die or have to run away to force a leash reset. [u]The caster mobs are particularly deadly because they have a spell that will slow you to a crawl, and in conjunction with Kang's void zones, you'll die almost instantly[/u]. \r\n\r\n2) [b]Location[/b]: Start by pulling Kang to the bottom edge of his hill, and work your way from his 5 o'clock starting position, up and around the hill. Only move as necessary to avoid the void zones, and try to keep them close together so you have room to move if you need it. The zones are persistent, and won't go away for several minutes, so [u]it's important not to trap yourself[/u]. \r\n\r\n3) [b]Damage mitigation/healing[/b]: Start the fight by using your short-duration defensive and offensive cooldowns. This fight took me close to 4-5 minutes as an elemental shaman soloing him, so I was able to use both of my elemental totems. Don't let yourself drop below 20% health if you can help it, because getting caught by a void zone will likely kill you. \r\n\r\n4) [b]Interrupts[/b]: His bolts aren't particularly harmful, but if you can interrupt them, do so if it won't hurt your DPS rotation or chance to get a heal off. If you have stuns or knockbacks, use those as he begins casting the void zones. I found it useful to use my healing spells immediately following a stun/knockback as it gave me time to cast without taking spell knockback. \r\n\r\n5) [b]Priority[/b]: Your priority is to stay alive, but also to finish him quickly. That being said, if the additional mobs start to respawn before your fight is over, kill the adds first. This goes especially for the caster mobs due to their slow effects. [u]Consider putting a focus frame on Kang at the start of the fight so that you can pay attention to when he's casting void zones and hopefully move/interrupt them if you have another mob in your face.
