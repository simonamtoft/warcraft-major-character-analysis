Instead, they opted to steal the name of the Blood God of the Gurubashi. When Hakkar was growing up on Argus, he was frequently made fun of by the bigger Fel Lords for his name. He became more and more reclusive, and whatever friends he did have soon abandoned him out of fear they themselves would be bullied. Noticing that their son was becoming distanced from his peers, they pulled him out of the Fel Reach Academy, the most prestigious school on Argus, and opted to homeschool him. During his studies of fel magic, he became increasingly irritated that he had no friends or companions to talk with, so his parents bought him a young mastiff. The two were instantly inseparable. Within a short span of five years, Hakkar scoured the demon worlds in search of other captured mastiffs, in order to train them himself. Mastiffs, who are not naturally inclined to serve demons, caused quite a spectacle when Hakkar was out in public. One day, he ran into those old Fel Lords who teased him at the Academy. Only this time, they were making fun of mortal hounds. Hakkar lost control of his temper, and ordered his hounds to kill the Fel Lords. The pair were quickly overwhelmed and devoured. It is said that they were killed so thoroughly, their very souls were consumed by the hounds themselves, which in turn corrupted them with fel magic, and transformed them into Soulstalkers. Hakkar earned respect among the members of the legion that day, and he was dubbed Hakkar the Houndmaster shortly after news of what happened had broke out. He was dispatched to patrol the Nighthold's grounds, a position far above what his prior classmates were able to achieve at the Academy. Hakkar remains there to this day.", "date": "2016-09-11T03:19:29-05:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Actually, Hakkar the Houndmaster came before Hakkar the Soulflayer ;).
