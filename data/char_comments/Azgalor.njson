{"commentv2": 1, "number": 14, "id": 232410, "nreplies": 4, "sticky": 0, "user": "RiceCake", "body": "Azgalor is the fourth boss of the Mount Hyjal raid instance, is the last boss with the waves of trash, and is also probably the first boss that you'll encounter that drops tier 6 gear (hands). He is also, without a doubt, the hardest of the four bosses in Mount Hyjal excluding Archimonde, and not only that, his trash waves could also be difficult to handle. In his trash waves, two new kinds of mobs get introduced, listed below. For information regarding the rest of the trash wave mobs, visit Rage Winterchill, Anetheron, and Kaz'rogal's pages.\n \nInferno: On the specific waves listed below, infernos will drop from the sky all around the Horde camp. The usual drop spots are immediately to the left of Thrall, to the back left of the raid group (assuming you are all bunched up at the entrance), in the Tauren Warrior camp, in the far back in front of the Trolls (and in front of a tower-like buliding), and way in the back to the right of Thrall (incidentally near a peon). Their drop spots are completely random, and multiple infernos could drop in one spot. When they drop, have all your warlocks, accompanied by one or two tanks and a couple of healers, run to the back and banish / fear as many as they can. Let the npcs tank the infernos, and keep your tanks near the Tauren Warriors to prevent any of them from dying. Your warlocks and the npcs should be enough to take the infernos down (hit for 2k on cloth with a ~800 aura), but if you don't have too many locks (3 or so are enough), let some ranged dps follow them also. Fortunately, inferno waves are usually accompanied by only a few and weak mobs.\n\nFel Stalkers: These don't hit too hard (~2k on cloth) and are banishable. However, they do tend to mana burn randomly for ~900 mana. Even then they're not a big deal, so just include them in your AoE.\n\nTrash mob strat: The Azgalor trash waves are an accumulation of all the mobs you've seen before but in amazingly deadly combinations. The waves marked below are actually some amazingly tough trash. Again, if you have a prot paladin, the trash waves' difficulty is drastically reduced, and if he has free action potions to get out of the abominations' stuns, most of the trash should be easy. Otherwise, there's really no real solution except some amazing tanking, sheeping, fearing, and AoE'ing. Except for the infernos, all the trash mobs enter from the front, and even then the infernos aren't usually the troublesome ones. However, there is a possibility that your AoE won't get the trash waves down in time and kill some Tauren Warriors that joined the fight. Make sure this doesn't ever happen by having your tanks watch out for them. Wave 6 and wave 8 are especially deadly waves. In wave 6, half of the mobs are most of the time immune to your AoE damage (due to the banshees' magic absorption aura), and the other half shoot deadly shadowbolts that could decimate any main tank in seconds. In that wave, let the npcs take the brunt, and use cc's liberally. The worst part is the the timer is fairly short on that wave, so your melee might have to take down the banshees fast (mindcontrolling the necromancers to boost your melee dps damage with their haste buff could be ideal). As for wave 8, it is dangerous due to the sheer amount of mobs that are in it, so unless your tanks are good, it could be pretty tough.\n\nWaves:\n1) 6 abominations, 6 shadowy necromancers (!!)\n2) 5 ghouls, 8 gargoyles, 1 frost wyrm (they enter from the front)\n3) 8 ghouls, 8 giant infernos (have your locks at the ready)\n4) 6 fel stalkers, 8 giant infernos\n5) 4 abominations, 6 fel stalkers, 4 shadowy necromancers (!)\n6) 8 shadowy necromancers, 8 banshees (!!!)\n7) 8 giant infernos, 2 fel stalkers, 2 crypt fiends, 2 ghouls\n8) 4 abominations, 4 crypt fiends, 2 fel stalkers, 2 shadowy necromancers, 4 banshees (!!)\n9) Azgalor\n\nThe Boss:\n\nI do say that Azgalor has a fairly sinister voice, although somewhat reminiscent of a person with smoker's lungs. He is chain-distractable like Kaz'rogal, but just as deadly if the distracts get resisted. A big part of the fight involves the Tauren Warriors, so make sure you have most if not all of them alive (otherwise you might as well give up, although it is not impossible). His abilities are as follows.\n\nMelee+Cleave: His cleave is serious business, and he hits fairly hard, combined with the silence mentioned below, you have a main tank killer. Make sure your tank has full round of HoTs on him at all times, no exceptions. Oh, tell your melee not to get in front of him :).\n\nRain of Fire: His rain of fire, although doesn't hit for much, leaves a debuff on every person hit that deals around 6k of fire damage in 5 seconds. Since the AoE effect is fairly large, have everybody in your raid spread out around him and run out immediately. Just to be sure, have them keep running until they are 100% positive that they're out of the fire. Top them off for they might die to debuff+silence. This could potentially be a problem for the melee, so have them gear up in fair amounts of FR gear (~150 to 200 unbuffed). The gear is easily acquired from heroic badges. \n\nHowl of Azgalor: An AoE silence effect that lasts for 5 seconds. This ability's cooldown is ~20 seconds, so he in effect spams it. Make sure that all HoTs are on both of your tanks at all times. Just from personal experience, Deadly Boss Mob's timer is oftentimes 3-4 seconds late.\n\nDoom: A debuff that he casts on a random person ~ every 50 seconds. After 20 seconds, the person will die, and a lesser doomguard will spawn. Have the debuffed person run directly to the offtank by the Tauren Warriors (run past the offtank for the doomguards take off immediately upon death). If the debuffed person dies with the debuff on him/her, the doomguard will spawn and often wreck havoc on the raid. Prevent this with good heals. Have your warlocks setup a soul stone rotation to recycle doomed people.\n\nLesser Doomguards: These doomguards could potentially be deadly once they pile up. However, that's what the offtank and the Tauren Warriors are for. If your debuffed people are quick on the move, they should be able to run to the offtank by the Tauren Warriors, die, and have the offtank pick up the doomguard with the Taurens dps'ing / stunning. Have a dedicated healer for the offtank. The doomguards do simple dps and stun occasionally.\n\nBoss strat: Once again, positioning is important. Azgalor will be tanked right in front of Thrall, so have your raid spread out by groups in a large circle around the potential tank spot to prevent major fire damage from the rain of fire. Have your locks be near the path between Thrall and the Tauren Warriors for easy soul stone application when the doomed person runs out. The offtank and the offtank healer should stay as far away as possible by the Tauren Warriors the whole time, managing the doomguards. Once your raid is ready for Azgalor, have a hunter misdirect the main tank by Thrall. Have everyone move away from his path, and then reform the circle once he has settled. If Thrall doesn't move behind Azgalor, spin Azgalor around, making sure no ranged takes the cleave. Have someone yell out the silence timer for better HoT application. Wipes usually occur when the main tank doesn't get enough HoTs during a silence, when the offtank (and healer) gets overwhelmed by doomguards, when the doomed person dies or simply forgets to run and releases a doomguard in the raid, or when people are simply too slow running out of fire.", "date": "2008-02-09T21:41:33-06:00", "rating": 49, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This is a good strat, and our guild tried doing this originally.

Spirit Bond is also highly recommended, as well as Glyph of Animal Bond and Glyph of Mending.\r\n\r\nThe trick for this boss is to avoid Doom, which has a range of 100yd, and here is how I have done it a couple of times:\r\n\r\nWhen engaging the boss, have a timer for Doom cooldown (I used default WoW stopwatch), which is 45 seconds. Go full dps for around 20 seconds, then start moving away from the boss, while spamming Hunter's Mark. [b]Pet needs to between you and boss[/b], otherwise it won't work. When you think you are 100yd away, slow down a bit, while still spamming hunter's mark. When you get an error message about target not in line of sight, stop immediately. Your pet should not despawn, because it's around 95-99yd from you, and you should be just over 100yd from the boss. Take note of your surroundings - this will help you find this magic distance again.\r\n\r\nWhen boss casts Doom, reset your timer, if you are using a stopwatch, and engage the boss with full dps again. Move away after 15-35 seconds, whatever you feel comfortable with. Rinse and repeat. If you have Lynx Rush, do not use it - it might mess up your positioning or even despawn your pet, if you are far away. Don't forget to mend your pet if it's health is getting low.\r\n\r\nIf your pet despawns, don't panic. You might still be able to pull it off if you quickly resurrect your pet. If you get Doom, die quickly and run back in as fast as possible.
