After you jump on the dragons from beating Queen Azshara, there's no need to sit through the cutscreen each time.  Talk to your dragon by right clicking the mount and you can skip ahead.   \r\n\r\nStrategy for easy kill:  This fight is not terribly taxing, but can result in deaths because of poor knowledge of the fight.\r\n\r\n1) Attack Varo'then.  NOT the big guy (Mannoroth) - he'll heal up if you don't attack the small boss anyway.  So it's just wasted time and dps.\r\n\r\n2) When Fel Firestorm is being cast, just keep on the move - run around in a circle.  They hit fairly hard and can cause deaths easily for people standing in the fire, ahem.  They seem to target a player and fall from the sky, much like the first boss in Baradin Hold.  So if you start moving as it begins, it will fall where you were one second before.  It is easily possible to avoid almost all damage if you are on the move.\r\n\r\n3) When Tyrande collapses and the adds mob her, everyone run into the light, get the buff, and then KILL THE TWO ADDS TO THE SIDES (Dreadlord Debilitator).  It's amusing (to a point) to watch groups kill wave after wave of the melee adds (they're endless afaik).  All you have to do is kill the Debilitators and they will release their glowey thread debuffing Tyrande and you can continue with the fight.  **Notes: with the buff, you do ridiculous damage to demons, so even the healer can pop a quick moonfire or something similar and kill them.\r\n\r\n4) Throw the sword left behind (right click it) to debuff Mannoroth, then bust him up.\r\n\r\n5) To make the fight easier on the tank and do more overall dps, a little placement is worth doing.  The adds all stream from a portal to the left of the boss.  Have the tank right of the boss (or wherever, doesn't matter too much), have heals stack on the tank, and have range dps stand right behind tank in a direct line from the portal.  This way the tank can just dps the boss while cleaving, and he'll pick up all the adds as they stream over him.\r\n\r\nHave fun.", "date": "2011-12-03T11:43:00-06:00", "rating": 15, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "**Even better - when you open the chest for loot after beating Queen Azshara, walk toward the back of the circular platform.
