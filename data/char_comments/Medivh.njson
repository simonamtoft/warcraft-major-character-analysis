{"commentv2": 1, "number": 8, "id": 1855904, "nreplies": 14, "sticky": 0, "user": "1062573", "body": "I used to have trouble with the chess event but found a strategy that was easily crushing the opponent (to the point that I'm ending the game with 8 pieces alive, all of theirs dead). I should note this is a combination of things I've seen from other people combined together with a few things of my own, but I don't see any info on it on wowhead, so I figured I'd post it.\r\n\r\nMake sure game sound is on, at least at the start, as you will be wanting to listen to an audio queu from Medivh.\r\n\r\n1) Start the game by activating your king and spam the leave vehicle button.\r\n2) Activate the pawn in front of the king as soon as possible (you can spam click it and hit escape if the say option isn't up yet), move it ahead one space, and get out as quickly as possible (don't even wait for the piece to finish moving, just hit move and get out of there).\r\n3) Take one of your pawns which is one from the end (i.e. in front of the knight) and move it ahead one space. Get out as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n--------- Here's where the real strategy starts ----------------\r\n\r\n4) Grab the Rook near the second pawn you moved and get it somewhere into the center as soon as possible.\r\n5) The goal is to exploit is Hellfire (aoe) ability. Spam is absolutely as much as possible. It has an aoe radius of 2, so position for maximum damage.\r\n6) First priority should be to wipe out large clumps of Footman\r\n7) Second priority, and something you do need to do, is to kill both of the enemy's healers, though you may have to do it one at a time.\r\n8) Try to position your Rook so it can melee a piece, preferably a healer when possible. The aoe is his main mechanic, but the melee damage will help on stronger pieces.\r\n9) Avoid taking too much damage on the Rook. In particular, keep moving him around so that he's not getting punched by enemy pieces. Remember that you don't have to \"run away\" from a piece to avoid getting hit, you just need to move to a direction they're not facing.\r\n\r\n--------- Medivh Cheating ----------------\r\n\r\n10) Medivh will cheat, but he'll have an audio queu before he activates the mechanic about evening the field. The first cheat will always be fire. The very moment you hear the queu, get out of your Rook and head to your King. You should be able to get him out of the fire only taking a few ticks. He won't do fire again.\r\n11) Throughout the fight, Medivh will empower units. You CANNOT let anything important (Rooks, Kings, or Queen) get meleed by these units. Even if it's just an enemy pawn, they hit INCREDIBLY hard when empowered, and will tear anything they melee apart.\r\n\r\n---------- Endgame ---------------\r\n\r\n12) To win, you need to clear much of the enemy's field (well, not technically, but it will help a lot). You do need to kill the enemy's healers.\r\n13) Use your judgement, but expend your Rooks first. Their aoe is incredibly powerful and they can do a lot of damage. After almost all enemy units are dead, their aoe isn't so great, which makes them good fodder for meleeing the enemy healers to death.\r\n14) You will want to end the game using the Queen. Unlike many strats, you will never actually be piloting the King; moving him forward tends to get him killed a lot when you can't control your healers at the same time. The Queen should first be picking off the remaining enemy healer (if both healers are up and at high health, you need to do better work with your Rooks). Once the enemy healers are dead, just focus on the King and he will fall. The Queen can attack from VERY far away, nuking the king down without even getting in his danger range. If he decides to stay on the far side of the field, your Queen nukes him down without taking any damage; if he comes in close, you should still have half a dozen units up that will pile damage onto him.\r\n\r\nFINAL NOTE: Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT just pull out a Rook and leave it there. You want to manually control them. If you leave the AI to do it's own thing, it will not Hellfire nearly enough. Furthermore, the AI is not smart enough to \"evade\" enemies. You want to keep trying to move the Rook around everytime enemy pieces are meleeing it, not to mention moving to where your aoe will do more damage. A single piloted Rook is 10 times more effective than 2 unpiloted Rooks moved to the center of the field. Other than saving your King from fire or empowered pieces, you should always be in the Rooks until either the enemy board has been cleared or both the Rooks are dead.", "date": "2013-05-22T12:32:22-05:00", "rating": 93, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent strategy, worked straight away for me.", "creationdate": "2013-11-10T19:09:22-06:00", "id": 707110, "rating": 2, "commentid": 1855904, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 256, "username": "UberRob", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "A bit convoluted, but worked first try.

The knight can easily get to the backline, while the rook can AoE many enemies at once and/or distract them. The main goal is to kill at least one Bishop (healer).

Their range is massive, and their damage is extremely high. As long as your king is not disproportionately low or somehow surrounded, you can pretty much snipe down their king at your leisure.

But, the [b][Occupy a piece][i][/i][/b] button is not so intuitively obvious.   So, the first step is you're told to click on the King to start playing.  That's fine; but, first time there, figuring what to do next while learning what the piece has for spells, not so intuitive. Clicking the button [b][Occupy a piece][i][/i][/b] does not let you occupy a piece, and exiting the piece seems more like game over than the path to continued playing.\nBut this is one of those times when you can enter another vehicle.\n\nIntuitively, you'd think that would be obvious to just think of each piece as a vehicle, and it is, once you know that.  There is a short cool down when leaving one 'vehicle' before you're allowed to enter another.\n\nPerhaps the game's been changed again; but, as for winning, I found it so easy... I wondered what the fuss was about.  However, I will say it's easy to lose when one just sits in the King, and keeps pressing the occupy a piece trying to change pieces while in the king:  (\"What do you mean I need to be closer, I'm in the space next to him, how much closer can I get?)... Nevertheless, this little, really quite fun, game could have had better programming logistics and it would have really been fun, and maybe a tad more intuitive.  Ex: instead of having to leaving a piece to occupy another, allow the use of the occupy a piece button on the targeted piece (if it's yours), but only  if the current piece has all spells in cool down.  The cool down was so short when outside the piece, that just by increasing the cast time, they could have achieved the same result without having to leave and enter all the time, allowing for more continuity, making it more like real chess. They could also have made it more like real chess by allowing all pieces to move the number of squares like the original game.  The 'queen' does that to some degree, and the knight.... but the others... not so much.  Have fun... I sure did.\n\nOne last thing.  Be sure when done to reset the game.  Fail to do so and you'll soon discover that you can't use your spells or weapons because [spell=39331].  Just return to [npc=16816] and reset the game.
