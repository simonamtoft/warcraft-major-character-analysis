Examples of this form of military rule include Germany and Japan after World War II or the American South during the early stages of Reconstruction. In addition it is used by governments to enforce their rule, for example after a coup d'\u00e9tat (Thailand 2006), when threatened by popular protests (Tiananmen Square protests of 1989), or to crack down on the opposition (Poland 1981).

Now we need to deal with Varima-\r\n\r\nThrall's orcish yells are heard from the throne room, there he stands with Sylvanas and heroes of the Horde victorious over Varimathras when you and your king barge in (Jaina remained behind, she won't deal with seeing Thrall), Varian orders the fight to be finished now - once and for all and just before the clash of forces happen - Jaina appears and freezes both armies, she teleports the Alliance forces to Stormwind.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival in Stormwind, King Varian tells you to go conquer Northrend for the Alliance. Putress has been slain, but his legacy remains - the fourth war has begun.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nOnce you arrive to Northrend, Alliance and Horde aren't fighting side by side but are fighting each other as the Lich King destroys them both and raises them into undeath, all neutral factions /facepalm as the world's fate is being gambled by this pointless war.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Alliance version completed, and thank you Avandas but i'll not update the information because your info is pretty much spot on. :D", "date": "2008-11-04T07:02:01-06:00", "rating": 51, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
