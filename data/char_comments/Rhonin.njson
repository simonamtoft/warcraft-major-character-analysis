I realise that I was a little flippant in my post, but Mary Sues usually do have everything go their own way and save the day.\r\n\r\nGiving him character flaws (which aren't really all that negative, such as his recklessness and hotheadedness) is merely there to make him seem more sympathetic. Nobody wants to read about a character who is perfect in every way.\r\n\r\nNow, the first book is fine if you like it, as the character is involved with his own arc, which is the driving force of the plot. And it builds on the established lore, without changing what went before, even opening the way for some new plotlines.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Knaak wrote him into his other books (the War of the Ancients trilogy), which were about events that happen thousands of years before Rhonin was born. Yet, through a plot contrivance he is sent back in time (time travel is another hallmark of Mary Sues) with two other of the author's own characters, who then have an effect on the outcome, tying him to Illidan, arguably most popular character in Warcraft (even if he didn't actually teach him, though incidentally mentor is a synonym for teacher), compounds the charge that he's a Mary Sue. The whole canon was altered because of that trilogy.\r\n\r\nNow, I freely admit I've never read his books (I like a better caliber of fantasy writer like Tolkien, Pratchett or Moor@#$%) but the lore of Azeroth is something that has always greatly interested me. I've always used resources like this site and wowwiki to find out the story of places like Grim Batol and the Greymane Wall, that are in game but have no content yet, and I played WC2 and WC3 (plus the expansions) before WoW was released so I do know a lot about the story. Having someone come in and retcon events just so he can write about his own characters kinda annoys me. And I also know Blizzard gave him their approval to make these changes, and that's something I can't understand. The War of the Ancients stands on it's own as a story, adding more characters to it is pointless, and creates lore problems Blizzard needs to then readdress. \r\n\r\nThen again, Blizzard isn't too bothered about upsetting the established lore to suit their own purposes, just look at the Draenei.", "date": "2008-11-20T16:39:59-06:00", "rating": 36, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
{"commentv2": 1, "number": 17, "id": 461689, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "236968", "body": "And those three characters have become very important characters in Warcraft lore - Rhonin is now the leader of the Kirin Tor in WotLK, Krasus is the consort of Alexastrasza and a prominent figure in WotLK, and Broxigar is brother to Saurfang and the first Orc to confront the Burning Legion head-on. It's not as if the author created these characters, imbued them with amazing abilities and made them important characters... Blizzard definitely had a hand in it, especially since they've been featured in the game since WoW was first released. Saurfang spoke of Broxigar and holds him in high-esteem, we see the ruins of the caravan that Deathwing attacked in Day of the Dragon near Grim Batol, the fact that Grim Batol is now overrun by red dragons and Deathwing has been missing since his defeat in the novel, the mention of Krasus in several quests, Falstad Wildhammer (Rhonin's companion) being the leader of the dwarves in the Hinterlands, and now Rhonin, Krasus and Veressa being their own NPCs in WotLK. \r\n\r\nThe novels definitely have an impact on the game (or maybe it's Blizzard just telling them what they can work with so it can be used in the game) - look at the novels The Last Guardian. It introduces us to Moroes, Medvih's assistant, now a boss in Karazhan. Or Lord of the Clans - where it shoes Thrall escaping with the help of Taretha Foxton, who is then featured in the game during the Escape from Hillsbrad instance and in a quest line in Hillsbrad where a servant of Thrall sends the player to recover Taretha's necklace. Or the novel Of Blood and Honor which sets up the relationship between Eitrigg and Tirion Fordring, which has been touched upon in the game several times now. \r\n\r\nAs for the Ancients trilogy, I seriously doubt the author went in and created this story that changed the lore so much and then had Blizzard go along with it - it's more like Blizzard told him what can be done and what's going to be changed to better fit their new lore. Obviously Blizzard changed a lot, not just with the War of the Ancients - as you said, Draenei backstory was changed as well. So it's not very fair to accuse the author of meddling and getting away with it. What happened in the Ancients trilogy is what Blizzard wanted to happen. And why can't the two go together, anyway? You have the normal timeline where things went as originally told, but then the time portal opens up 10,000 years later which sends the three figures into the past, where they change and affect some of it, creating a new timeline. Illidan, Malfurion, Tyrande, Cenarius, the dragons.. those guys are still the heroes of the story, the truly powerful figures, but Rhonin and the others still have their impacts. Broxigar helps to slow down the Legion advance just enough to allow the others to shut the portal by causing a little scratch on Sargeras, for instance, but he's ultimately killed in the process. It's not detracting from the major players in any bit. Illidan is still Illidan, etc. \r\n\r\nThink of it like the Star Wars books - the authors can't go and kill the Big Three, and they're all bound to the canon of Star Wars. They can't go and do whatever they please with their stories, they have to abide by each other's works, etc. You can't have a story where Luke goes back in time and fixes the past so Anakin doesn't become Vader, you can't have a character dying in one book and reappearing in another, can't make any galaxy-changing events unless it's done with the approval of the Licensing people at Lucas who manage it all, etc. Knaak isn't doing anything more than what's given to him by Blizzard.", "date": "2008-11-21T19:56:13-06:00", "rating": 26, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
