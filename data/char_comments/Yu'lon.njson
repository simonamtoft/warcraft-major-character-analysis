It still suggests a strategy involving our precious kitty at the end of the post\n\nAnother strategy to keep the kitty power going is from [url=https://www.wowhead.com/npc=72291/yula-broodling-of-yulon#comments:id=3290585]kurri's comment[/url] who suggests to end the fight with an Anubisath Idol after our favorite undead cat dies.\n\n[b]Soloed with Mr. Bigglesworth using:[/b]\n\n- Claw\n- Ice Barrier\n- Ice Tomb\n\n[b]Yu'la's attack sequence is:[/b]\n- Emerald Presence\n- Lift-Off\n- Jade Breath\n- Jade Breath\n- Jade Breath\n\n\n[b]Rotation Used:[/b]\n- Claw\n- Ice tomb\n- Ice Barrier\n- PASS TURN\n- Claw\n- Claw\n- Repeat (including the first claw)\n\n[b](Unneeded) Explaination:[/b]\n\nMr. Bigglesworth is faster than Yu'la, which allows you to have more control on the fight, and the combo Ice Tomb + Ice Barrier is very effective against scripted fights, since Yu'la will keep attacking even with the barrier up wasting his attacks while Ice Tomb comes down, which will also prevent another Jade Breath due to the stun. Moreover, with this strategy you will receive very little damage during the fight (compared to getting all attacks):\nJade Breath does less damage against Mr. Bigglesworth (since he's Undead) and he will manage to succesfully use only one during the rotation as one will be blocked by ice barrier and the other won't be casted because of Ice Tomb's stun (he will continue with his rotation rather than delaying it to cast a 3rd Jade Breath), on top of that, since there are no attacks made close to each other, he'll never benefit from the dragon buff. Finally, his Lift-Off will be blocked by Ice Barrier. Mr. Bigglesworth has very little HP but, except in the case where you are very unlucky, he won't die (my worst fight was when i had 2 missed claws and got a crit from a jade breath, but i managed to solo Yu'la in the \"Death Turn\")\n\n- On the first turn, Yu'la will use Emerald Presence, you can just Claw. \n- Then he will Lift-Off, you will use Ice Tomb (since Mr. Bigglesworth is faster, the attack will hit before Lift-Off)\n- Use Ice Barrier to block Lift-Off attack, then pass the next turn so he'll break the barrier with his Jade Breath, allowing Ice Tomb to hit\n- Yu'la is stunned, which will prevent him from using one of the Jade Breaths in his rotation\n- Keep Clawing until he uses Emerald Presence again. \n- The turn after he uses Emerald Presence he will Lift-Off, so you can keep track of the Emerald Presence to know when you have to use Ice Tomb and then Ice Barrier. Like before, use Ice Tomb in the same turn when he'll Lift-Off (tip: you can easily time your attacks after the first rotation because you will have to use them as soon as the cooldown is ready, so after the first time, just use them when ready)\n- Rinse and Repeat\n\n[b]Make sure you put Claw and not Pounce[/b]\nEven though Mr. Bigglesworth is faster than Yu'la (which would make Pounce potentially deal more damage than Claw), Pounce's damage is actually split in 2 attacks, which will be reduced by the \"boss\" buff and Emerald Presence, while the extra damage from Pounce will be completely blocked.\nThere is still a chance to win with Pounce as 1st skill (i did it for mistake the first time i fought Yu'la, when i came out with this strategy), but it'll take way longer.\n\n\n[s]I have to admit i'm not sure if he uses Emerald Presence just before Lift-Off, i was using Pettracker to keep track of Lift-Off CD and i used Ice Tomb whenever i saw Lift-Off was ready. But i'm pretty sure that's the correct sequence (if someone can confirm this, otherwise i'll do by myself the next ti'me i'll fight Yu'la)[/s] Rotation confirmed (Thanks Quaaid for confirmation and more precise attack routine, i was too focused on the fight to keep track of my attacks but i wanted to share this strategy as soon as possible)", "date": "2013-09-15T07:20:59-05:00", "rating": 679, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Perfect strat, thank you.

Don't get me wrong, rabbit pets aren't super powerful, however between the burrow & dodge abilities I was able to miss the uplift attack and breath abilities a lot.  Plus I basically got two free attacks in when she put up her shield, and right before she flew up. (The bunny is faster, so you go first, which is important.)  If you're lucky enough to have the Darkmoon Rabbit, his first ability also has a bleed effect, that might even help more.  It was basically like getting pecked to death by a duck. But it worked!  So if you're down to your last straw, and are looking for pets that are still alive to beat her, don't overlook your rabbits...  Hope this unexpected (and probably crazy sounding) advice helps to get you your victory.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add in what order works the best for me.\nRabbit uses the 1st ability (usually Scratch) TWICE.  Then Dodge.  Then Burrow.  So, the encounter would look like this:\nBunny Pet > Scratch  ----  Yu'la > Emerald Presence\nBunny Pet > Scratch  ----  Yu'la > Lift-off (flies up)\nBunny Pet > Dodge  ----  Yu'la > Lift-off (attacks)\nBunny Pet > Scratch (as Dodge should still be up)  ----  Yu'la > Jade Breath\nBunny Pet > Burrow (go under ground) ----  Yu'la > Jade Breath\nBunny Pet > Burrow (attack)  ----  Yu'la > Jade Breath (yes you'll take some damage)\n*Now keep using scratch until it's time to dodge the lift-off ability.... rinse & repeat basically.\n\nI personally use two rabbit pets and Bonkers (although, I've never had to ever use my third pet yet).\n\nEdit: I recorded a video on YouTube on how to do this:  [url=http://youtu.be/OEo4fzZajXw]http://youtu.be/OEo4fzZajXw[/url]", "date": "2013-09-30T19:45:32-05:00", "rating": 298, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You just saved my sanity.

The change means that now all damage adding or reducing moves add or remove their damage at the last step of the damage calculation, where as before it worked with the formula (damage+flat bonus)*multiplier. This carries over to elite pets who use emerald presence or stone skin type abilities, or sandstorm, this effectively gives the opponent massive damage reductions. Where as before flat damage buffs gave shattered defenses massive damage increases the exact opposite problem is now fully realized in battle pets. Any battle pet strategy on this page that relies on a move that does 252 damage or less will do zero damage against yu'la. The rabbit strategy is no longer viable, mr bigglesworth is easily out matched by yu'la now and can no longer solo yu'la, bonkers likewise suffers, strategies using curse of doom+unholy ascension+black claw+ flock/hunting party followed with a strong heavy hitter can no longer score enough damage from the flock stage to work. In order to damage yu'la they must be under the effects of a static damage increase of similar effectiveness of black claw, be under the effect of a 100% damage increase such as howl, or both. My calculations show that a team of 3 chrominius at level 25 with howl and surge of power using a howl - pass for takeoff - surge of power the turn takeoff hits should kill yu'la in 3 rotations but this is untested and a single bite may be needed in the rotation per chrominius, this is extremely difficult to test due to the limited availability of yu'la.\n\nEdit: Upon running further numbers the Mr. Bigglesworth Strategy can still work but on average he will no longer be able to solo Yu'la. The 6 turn rotation strategy will do on average 272 damage, while he will take 336 damage per rotation. This means that in 4+1 partial rotations (max 29 turns) mr bigglesworth will die provided he takes no crits, meaning on average he will do ~1340 damage before death. My new strategy recommendation is using mr bigglesworth in the standard rotation, save 2 chrominius at full health and use the howl+surge of power rotation (doing 614 damage per chrominius) and avoid using either during Yu'la's lift off round, this should be a relatively reliable method but will be extremely slow.", "date": "2020-10-15T00:54:44-05:00", "rating": 20, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely doesnt work any more. 6 straight fails.
