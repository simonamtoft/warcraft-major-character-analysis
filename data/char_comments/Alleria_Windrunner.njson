You can safely drop the orb ontop of Alleria for the beginning of the fight before she aggros. Alleria is a ranged attacker, so if you're melee, you have to go to her. It is also possible to stand behind a pillar to draw her towards you if she's not casting anything else. \n\nAlleria's abilities by default are Void Eruption and Dark Skies. Dark Skies fires arrows into the air that crash down on little swirls on the ground that do a bit of sanity damage. Void Eruption is cast when she gets 100% mana. She'll teleport and begin channeling a big explosion which does a TON of sanity damage. Just hide behind one of the cathedral's pillars to avoid it. \n\nClearing the Dwarven District will give her Explosive Ordinance. She will throw these bombs at where you're standing and you need to kick them away or move away, or else their fire will drain your sanity. You can control where they're kicked by the direction you're facing them, but honestly, they're so small and it's so hard to click them in-time before they explode, it's probably just best to kick them away even if they go in a random direction. You'll typically be fighting her in the middle anyway. \n\nClearing the Trade District will give her Chains of Servitude. This ability, thank god, was nerfed to only be cast once per fight. She channels a chain that will drain sanity if you're within a few feet of her. Just run away, but be careful if you have Mask of the Burned Bridge, as the chain can pull you back onto your own burned bridge spots. \n\nClearing the Mage District gives her Tainted Polymorph. This is a simple interrupt cast, but it's also one of her most dangerous abilities, especially with Burned Bridge, as it leaves you wide open for her other sanity-draining attacks and leaves you moving (as a sheep) onto of your Burned Bridge spots. \n\nFinally, clearing Old Town makes an Eye of N'zoth accompany her during the fight. This little eye is invincible and facing towards it with your character causes sanity loss. It teleports around the room (typically right next to you) every 10-15 seconds and, in a movement-heavy fight like this, little glances of this eye are going to rack up sanity damage pretty fast if you're not careful.", "date": "2020-07-23T16:20:06-05:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2020-07-23T16:20:36-05:00", 1, "sitecow09"]}
