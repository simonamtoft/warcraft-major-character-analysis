His special abilities as far as I saw:\r\n\r\n1) Apparently has a disease which causes a healing debuff, although I was too busy to check debuff tooltips so I can't confirm this exactly, additionally we had a shaman with a disease cleansing totem out.\r\n\r\n2) Casts \"Bane\", which is a melee-range reactive AOE centered around him. Appeared to tick for about 1500 shadow damage, and pulses every time he is struck in combat while Bane is active (which is around 10 seconds). While Bane is active he will still run around and attack players as usual, but as long as he is not attacked during this time Bane should do minimal damage. Anti-Magic Shell works to absorb damage if for some reason your group mates (or a dumb-AI pet like a Ghoul) won't stop attacking him.\r\n\r\n3) Has a melee attack called something like Dark Strike (not too sure on this) which apparently halves your HP if hit. This can be dodged/parried/etc.\r\n\r\n4) At certain intervals he will cause your party to cower in fear and run up to one of his boats to gain a special ability. The fear can be broken with trinkets, tremor totem, etc. allowing you to attack him while he's doing his boat ritual. As for the special ability he gains, I think it depends on which boat he visits which itself appears random.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 7, "id": 468136, "nreplies": 1, "sticky": 0, "user": "176943", "body": "Strat for Ymiron (Heroic):\n\nHe'll start off by hitting 4-5k on plate so the healer does have to watch out. He will also put up Bane which reflects 1400-1500 damage per attack to everyone within 10-15 yards. Your melee [i]has[/i] to watch out for this. The best option imho is to have an enh sham because it's purgable and dispellable. If there is no dispel option, you'll just have to have your dps rein themselves in until it wears off.\n\nAfter each 20% he'll run to a boat, gain a new ability and lose the last boat ability (he always hits for 4-5k and occasionally buffs himself with Bane). He'll also stun the whole group into a /cower, which can make for funny screenshots.\n\nAbilities starting from the Back Left Boat going Clockwise if you're standing facing the throne.\n\n- (Back Left) Allows King Ymiron to summon a flood of adds. On normal it's around 4, but on heroic it can be upwards of 10. Each hit from the adds stacks a 2% decrease in attributes debuff and they attack fairly quickly. I've seen this stack up to 20. My suggestion here is for the healer and dps to stack together (presumably right behind Ymiron) and for the dps to aoe them down (they're weak). You can also run to the tank but you run the risk of the tank's max health dropping below 20k since they'll instinctively thunderclap/lay down consec/swipe/DnD.\n\n- (Front Left) Allows the summoning of a large crackling orb. Kite Ymiron away from it and you'll be fine, this is probably the easiest phase. If you don't it's a 5k aoe tick around it every 2-3 seconds.\n\n- (Front Right) Gives Ymiron a stacking +damage modifier of +1000 damage (applied on the tank). This will stack up to 6 times as far as I've seen, meaning each of Ymiron's hits will do +6000 damage on top of however much it was before. I didn't have much trouble with this one where I thought I'd struggle, maybe the warr hit shield wall without saying anything. Ran this again with a prot pally specifically requesting him not to use pally shield wall, on paper it seems like a devastating ability but he didn't hit all that hard /shrug. If you have a crittable tank it may be an issue though.\n\n- (Back Right) And lastly, this one houses the deadliest ability. A constant 4.5k aoe (resistable) every 4 seconds or so. Your healer is going to have some problems with this part regardless of class so blow all your cds and try to get through it as quickly as possible. Edit: I've had runs where this comes quick and heavy and runs where it isn't quite so bad, I'm not sure if it's just a really random cd. I believe it can also be outrangeable at somewhere around 30 yards, hard to tell because I run regularly with entirely melee groups. Edit: I don't think it's outrangeable, maybe someone can confirm either way.\n\nThis fight can be painful depending on your group make-up, namely if the healer is not very well geared and/or is a holy pally not quite used to using beacon (he/she will need it for this fight most likely for aoes) and too many melee dps get hit before the tank can kite Ymiron away from the orb.\n\nThe caveat to this boss is his hp is rather low. He has abilities on par with old T6 bosses but if your group's dps is high you can push him through phases fairly quickly before they even get to work.", "date": "2008-11-24T22:29:37-06:00", "rating": 33, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Bane will reflect 5k on heroic.

His people, the Dragonflayer clan, are still fanatically loyal to him.\r\nHaving recently proven himself to the Lich King, he was converted to the undead and is the last boss of Utgarde Pinnacle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbilities\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nBane: Surrounds King Ymiron with an aura that deals 1414-1586 (Heroic: 5k to 6k+) shadow damage to nearby enemies on every attack.\r\n\r\nDark Slash: Slashes current aggro target with darkness, dealing damage equal to 50% of targets total health.\r\n\r\nFetid Rot: Afflicts the target with a disease dealing 1414-1586 (Heroic: 2828 to 3172) damage every 3 seconds for 9 seconds and decreasing healing received by 25%. \r\nDispellable.\r\n\r\nScreams of the Dead: Delivers a bone chilling scream stunning all party members for 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nSpirit Burst: AoE. Deals 2357 to 2643 (Heroic: 4k to 5k+) damage to all targets. Only occurs when Ranulf's blessing is active.\r\n\r\nSpirit Strike: Deals 925 to 1075 (Heroic: 4625 to 5375) damage to current target and increases physical damage done by 250 (Heroic: 1000). It is stackable, lasts 10 seconds, and only occurs when Haldor's blessing is active.\r\n\r\n\r\nTactics\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThis fight requires little strategy but is still quite difficult, particularly in heroic.\r\nThe primary aspect of this fight is that he hits the tank VERY hard. His normal hits are for ~3k-5k and Dark Slash hits the tank for 50% of their health.\r\nOccasionally, King Ymiron will cast Bane which causes shadow damage when he is attacked. All DPS need to stop attacking when Bane is up. It needs to be dispelled or spell stolen immediately so dps can resume.\r\nHe will also occasionally cast Fetid Rot on a random party member, which needs to be removed as quickly as possible.\r\nEvery 33% HP on normal, and every 20% on heroic, King Ymiron will cast Screams of the Dead, which stuns the entire party for 8 seconds(mages can blink out of this stun). He will then randomly run to one of the 4 longboats in the room and channel a spell from a Vrykul ancestor there. This will give him an additional ability for the next 33 or 20% of his life. After reaching the next 33/20% mark, the previous longboat will burn and that ability will end. Thus, Ymiron will call on two ancestors' blessings during his normal battle, and all four during his heroic battle.\r\nWith respect to Ymiron's throne, these boats do:\r\nNear Left Boat (Haldor) - Gives the target the debuff Spirit Strike that increases damage taken. Will stack over time!\r\nNear Right Boat (Bjorn) - Allows him to summon Spirit Fount, an orb that does AoE shadow damage and moves around the room slowly. Ymiron needs to be kited away from the Fount and party members need to stay away from it.\r\nFar Left Boat (Ranulf) - Give him the ability to cast spirit burst, an AoE shadow nova for ~2k (Heroic: ~4-5k)\r\nFar Right Boat (Tor) - Allows King Ymiron to summon 4 Avenging Spirit adds that can be AoE'd down.", "date": "2009-02-25T13:20:47-06:00", "rating": 8, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
