When warned by Alleria Windrunner of the potential threat of an alliance between the Horde and the Amani forest trolls under Zul'jin, Dar'Khan scoffed and believed that they would not be able to get past the Runestones that protected the borders of Eversong Woods.\r\n\r\nAs a magister of Quel'Thalas, Dar'Khan used the Sunwell to help construct the cities, shape the land, and attain whatever the high elves desired. He was also a friend of future Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron. Lack of recognition for his part in these glorious deeds, coupled with his own egotistical nature, pushed him down a dark path and he began to secretly develop his own magics, as well as an obsession with the Sunwell. Frustrated by a lack of progress, Dar'Khan was elated when Prince Arthas reached out to aid him, and pledged his loyalty to the despoiler of Lordaeron. \r\n\r\nManipulated and strengthened by his \"Blessed Lord\", it was his friendship with Lor'themar that allowed Dar'Khan to help Arthas and his army slip through the Quel'Thalassian defenses, slaughtering his own comrades in the process, all the while believing that Arthas was helping him to fulfill his desire for the Sunwell's power. While he battled his fellow magi for control of the Sunwell, Arthas used it to revive Kel'Thuzad, destroying it in the process. \r\n\r\nAshamed of his failure and unaware of Arthas' role in the destruction, Dar'Khan was sent to track down where the remaining magic had gone. \r\n\r\nThe Sunwell Trilogy \r\nDar'khan assaulting Quel'Thalas.Following years of fruitless searching he finally neared his goal, detecting the Sunwell's presence near a peasant girl named Anveena Teague, who had also drawn attention from members of the Blue Dragonflight. Dar'Khan, now skilled in necromancy and commanding Scourge forces, attempted to capture her and ascertain the power's whereabouts. After failed attempts at her home and again in Tarren Mill, he finally came to the realization that she was, in fact, an Avatar of the Sunwell's power in humanoid form. Kidnapping her in Alterac Mountains and spiriting her to the ruined lands of Quel'Thalas, now known as the Ghostlands, he confronted her with the truth of her existence. \r\n\r\n \r\nDar'khan is destroyed.Dar'Khan then attempted to cast a spell which would allow him to absorb the energies from her, however with the aid of her allies, Anveena manifested the Sunwell's power and wielded it against him.

I had Elixir of Minor Fortitude, Bobbing Apple, and Blood Thistle for buffs. Once you get inside Dar' Khans dungeon tomb the trick is to take out all the mobs quickly. There is 1 patrol, 4 summoning casters, and Dar' Khan himself. \r\n\r\nOnce you kill the patrol shade, quickly kill each summoner, and their minions on both sides of the second level. When you reach the room with Dar' Khan move to the edges of the door way on either side to kill each of the remaining two summoners. They will not aggro Dar' Khan. However, trying to pull Dar' Khan alone will aggro both summoners/minions onto you. \r\n\r\nRest up quickly to ensure the respawns will not cause you problems so it's just you and Dar' Khan. Make sure your Sunwell Blade is armed. Throw a couple of Frostbolts and counterspell him if he tries to Shadowbolt you. Once he is in range use your Sunwell Blade for the 500+ dmg/Silence effect over 5 secs. If you fail to use this blade it will more than likely lead to your death.\r\n\r\nHere is where the skill comes into play. Freeze with your Water Elemental or use your own Nova. Kite him up and down the stairwells in a rectangular pattern. Anytime he stops to cast, snare with Frostbolt, and get off a Fireblast. If he is about to cast  line of site him. Blink to keep your distance but do not get to far ahead, or he will circle the other way and come from behind. He will focus alot of his corruptions and fear on your Elemental, but it's better him than you. Expect to take a corruption and a fear every now in then. It's hard to use your elementals freeze in this situation, but use it whenever you can while your Nova is on cooldown. Cone of Cold is a very useful snare here too. I'm an herbalist so Life Blood in addition to First Aid saved me as well. \r\n\r\nA player in Heirloom items, and green/blue grafted or purchased gear would be able to do this without even kiting. However, if your are not in this situation and have good movement skills you can pull this strategy off. By good movement skills I simply mean you move with your mouse NOT WASD. The spell dmg potion you receive for 10x Spinal Dust would help tremendously as well. This strategy is for Frost Mages with the new talent trees implemented for Cataclysm. As a wise Mage once told me 4 years ago...\"If you can snare it, you can kill it\". Good luck getting the rare quest staff on your own, and thanks for reading my post.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: Excuse my post that turned into a book, and also my horrible punctuation/grammar. I'm a wow player not an English Major. I hope this info can help any class who has a pet and is capable of kiting.

Kill all mobs on the outer ring of the tower. (both pairs of Eye of Dar'khan and anything that wanders around)\n\n2: Enter the tower. Go one path and kill the mobs on that side. Use Fear if necessary.\n\n3: Now go to the other side and kill the mobs there. If anything wanders around and tries to kill you, just kill it back. Make sure you've destroyed the wandering Wailer and the Eye of Dar'khan before you proceed to Step 4.\n\n4: This is the hard part. Switch to your imp and make sure you can actually see the necromancer or its pet in the circular room where Dar'khan is standing. Then target it and kill it. Be absolutely CERTAIN your imp will not aggro anyone else, ESPECIALLY Dar'khan. Recommendation is to start on the left side outside of the dome and kill the mobs on the right side of the room.\n\n5: Repeat #4, except on the other side of the room. This will be a tad trickier.\n\n6: Now this is the fun part. Switch back to your VW, cast Dark Regeneration, trigger Soulstone, and (sort of) Leeroy into the room. Dar'Khan is immune to your Fear spell, so don't mind wasting mana on it. I was a blood elf while I was doing this, so I used my racial passive Arcane Torrent ability to stop him from casting [i]his[/i] Fear. If you exit the room while you are Feared, make sure you get close enough to Dar'Khan as possible when it's done. If your VW dies, resummon it immediately. If you're low on mana (which happens a LOT), use Life Tap, but not so much that you're almost at the point of dying. If you die, make sure Dar'khan's returned back to the circular room before using your Soulstone for resurrection. Use your Healthstone if you've got the time.\n\n7: If you beat him, congrats! Take his head and go to Magister Keandris. He'll send you to Lor'themar Theron and you'll be dubbed a hero of the sin'dorei. (If you're not a blood elf, you'll become their best friend.)\n\n[i]P.S.
