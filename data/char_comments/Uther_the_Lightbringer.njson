Touch that blade and your soul will be scarred for all eternity! I must attempt to commune with the spirits locked away within Frostmourne. Give me space. Back up, please.\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: Jaina! Could it truly be you?\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore says: Uther! Dear Uther! I... I'm so sorry.\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: Jaina, you haven't much time. The Lich King sees what the sword sees. He will be here shortly.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore says: Arthas is here? Maybe I...\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: No, girl. Arthas is not here. Arthas is merely a presence within the Lich King's mind. A dwindling presence...\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore says: But Uther, if there's any hope of reaching Arthas. I... I must try.\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: Jaina, listen to me. You must destroy the Lich King. You cannot reason with him. He will kill you and your allies and raise you all as powerful soldiers of the Scourge.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore says: Tell me how, Uther? How do I destroy my prince? My...\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: Snap out of it, girl. You must destroy the Lich King at the place where he merged with Ner'zhul - atop the spire, at the Frozen Throne. It is the only way.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore says: You're right, Uther. Forgive me. I... I don't know what got a hold of me. We will deliver this information to the King and the knights that battle the Scourge within Icecrown Citadel.\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: There is... something else that you should know about the Lich King. Control over the Scourge must never be lost. Even if you were to strike down the Lich King, another would have to take his place. For without the control of its master, the Scourge would run rampant across the world - destroying all living things.\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: A grand sacrifice by a noble soul...\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore says: Who could bear such a burden?\r\nUther shakes his head.\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: I do not know, Jaina. I suspect that the piece of Arthas that might be left inside the Lich King is all that holds the Scourge from annihilating Azeroth.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore says: Then maybe there is still hope...\r\nThe far door opens and the Lich King appears!\r\nUther the Lightbringer says: No, Jaina! ARRRRRRGHHHH... He... He is coming. You... You must...\r\nThe Lich King yells: SILENCE, PALADIN!\r\nThe Lich King banishes Uther to the abyss.\r\nThe Lich King yells: So you wish to commune with the dead? You shall have your wish.\r\nThe Lich King summons in Falric and Marwyn, then retraces his steps back to the north.\r\nThe Lich King yells: Falric. Marwyn. Bring their corpses to my chamber when you are through.\r\nFalric yells: As you wish, my lord.\r\nMarwyn yells: As you wish, my lord.\r\nFalric yells: Soldiers of Lordaeron, rise to meet your master's call!\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: You won't deny me this, Arthas! I must know... I must find out... \r\n\r\nAllianceEntering the Shadow Throne\r\nThe Lich King yells: Your allies have arrived, Jaina, just as you promised. You will all become powerful agents of the Scourge.\r\nJaina voices the sentences \"There's nothing left of Arthas. Only the Lich King remains...\"\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: He is too powerful, we must leave this place at once! My magic will hold him in place for only a short time! Come quickly, heroes!\r\nStarting the gauntlet\r\nThe Lich King yells: There is no escape!\r\nFirst ice wall\r\nThe Lich King yells: Death's cold embrace awaits.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: I will destroy this barrier. You must hold the undead back!\r\nSecond ice wall\r\nThe Lich King yells: Succumb to the chill of the grave.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: Another ice wall! Keep the undead from interrupting my incantation so that I may bring this wall down!\r\nThird ice wall\r\nThe Lich King yells: Another dead end.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: We're almost there... Don't give up!\r\nLast ice wall\r\nThe Lich King yells: How long can you fight it?\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: Your barriers can't hold us back much longer, monster. I will shatter them all!\r\nGauntlet ends\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: There's an opening up ahead. GO NOW!\r\nThe path ends there - you're trapped! As he approaches, the Lich King laughs maniacally.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: It... It's a dead end. We have no choice but to fight. Steel yourself heroes, for this is our last stand!\r\nThe Lich King yells: Nowhere to run... You're mine now!\r\nAt that moment, The Skybreaker comes up from below!\r\nSky-Captain Justin Bartlett yells: Fire! FIRE!\r\nThe Skybreaker's guns open fire on the tunnel, collapsing it. A ramp leading up to the deck is lowered.\r\nSky-Captain Justin Bartlett yells: Quickly, climb aboard! We mustn't tarry here. There's no telling when this whole mountainside will collapse!\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: Forgive me, heroes. I should have listened to Uther. I... I just had to see for myself. To look into his eyes one last time. I am sorry.\r\nLady Jaina Proudmoore yells: We now know what must be done.
