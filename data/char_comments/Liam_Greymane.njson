In that world, all vampires are evil, because they're just demons inhabiting a human corpse; the original human soul is gone. However, Angel was cursed with a spell that gave him back his soul, giving him back the ability to have human feelings again.\r\n\r\nA human transformed into a murderous creature-of-the-night, then given back his human feelings by a spell? Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nAngel was originally from Ireland, and his human name had been [b][u]Liam[/u][/b].\r\n\r\nCoincidence? There's no such thing. But if it's really a reference, it's pretty obscure: Angel appeared in 165 episodes overall, if I remember correctly, and his human name had been mentioned about three times. Either way, I love this. :)\r\n\r\n[small](P.S.: I just hope I'm putting this to the right version of this character.
