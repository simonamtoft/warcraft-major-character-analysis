Though the Jade Warlord might be, but then again, the Jade Army of the Mogu was already a thing in the Vale.\n\nThe Monkey King is an actual Chinese myth from \"the Journey to the West\". He's the main character, a 'monkey born from a stone' (sounds familiar?) who uses supernatural power to challenge and prank the Gods themselves. It is one of the most popular myths and has spawned a lot of spin-offs, most noticably in anime such as Dragonball* and Naruto**.\n\nRead more about it here. It's a great, great story: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West[/url]\nAnd the Monkey King himself, Sun Wukong: [url= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong[/url]\n\nBack before MoP was released I was already hoping that they'd reference this great tale, especially after revealing the Hozen. I'm very glad they did. First in the story of Emperor Shaohao, and now later where we actually get to meet our mask-crafting prankster.\n\n\n* Dragonball's Goku of course having a monkey tail, flying a nimbus cloud, and having an extending/retracting Bo staff pre-DragonballZ. Also the Monkey King is named Sun Wukong, which got japanized to \"Son Goku\" for the anime, shortened to \"Goku\" for us westerners.
