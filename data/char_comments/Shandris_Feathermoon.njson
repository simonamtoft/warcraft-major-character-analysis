{"commentv2": 1, "number": 43, "id": 1628028, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "954549", "body": "As Shandris Feathermoon is my favourite character, I decided to tell a bit of her history per short. Of course you can look on wowpedia or somewhere else, but not all info there is correct.\r\n\r\nIn War of the Ancients triology we find that she was 16 when Queen Azshara invited the Legion into the world. She and other survivors from a village/town were trying to escape the legion, th Resistance saved them. Her parents had already been killed so she attached herself to Tyrande so to say. Even from then she was an excellent archer, killing/wounding some satyrs that attacked Tyrande before she was taken. She had a crush on Jarod Shadowsong, leader of the resistance and brother of Maiev.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Tyrande took her under her wing and she started to consider her as an adoptive mother, as seen in the Tyrande short story on the blizzard website. She was also trained in the art of the priesthood of Elune besides getting archery an tactics training. In the short story we're shown a moment of her life before the Cataclysm where she stays behind to defend Feathermoon Stronghold from naga attacks so that all night elves could escape. She was critically injured in this story but Tyrande and Malfurion saved her. \r\n\r\nStill, she got to the Feathermoon Stronghold since the night elves wanted to reclaim their old land, expand etc. During the book \"Stormrage\" we find out that she has an extensive network of spies all along Kalimdor which seem to communicate extremely fast with one another, rumoured through the buzzboxes (like the ones in Classic WoW Darkshore). She goes to keep things in check in Darnassus while Tyrande goes to save Malfurion in this book. She's later hit in the head by Fandral but recovers.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the markings on her face are the marks of an earlier rite of passage. She was there when the Legion first attacked in the events of Warcraft 3, the town she defended being one of the first attacked, and she was there at the war for Nordrassil. \r\n\r\nIn game, in Classic Wow she acted as a leader of a small outpost, sending you to find missing night elves and research the naga, while since Cataclysm she has the second biggest alliance non-capital base, filled with an army of night elves, worgen, glaive throwers and all other means of creatures you, the player, are sent to ask to rejoin the night elven army. She also sends you to battle for a foothold in Scarlet Monastery and to help the Alliance in Stranglethorn. \r\n\r\nRelating to her relationship with Jarod, it is seemed that in a book, Wolfheart I belive but not sure, it is said that she did have some time together with Jarod, but she wanted to be more involved in the decisions of her people while Jarod wanted to go in the shadow. Jarod met a young priestess and left Shandris one day without a word. Said priestess died, and the meeting of Jarod and Shandris in Cataclysm was awkward to say the least. \r\n\r\n\r\nTalking about in-game mechanics, at the start of Cataclysm she used to be kited to Orgrimmar. Because of her AoE Moonfire ability, she could kill anyone in 1-2 seconds. Actually, even if Garrosh Hellscream had double her life, she 1-shot him with this ability... if this was cannonical, she'd now be the warchief of the Horde, so if you're Horde and reading this, you should bow to her, not to Garrosh!", "date": "2012-02-17T10:51:05-06:00", "rating": 13, "indent": 0, "roles": 16384, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
