Learn from each time you try, a death is never useless if you learn from it. \r\n3.

Bring and use augment runes, food, and any other consumables that provide a stat buff. \r\n6. If after several attempts you can't win give it a break for a bit, come back later ideally with a higher ilvl but if nothing else with a fresh mind and approach. \r\n7.
