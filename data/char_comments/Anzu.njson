While it is easier in level 80 epics, the first time I did it I was still wearing mostly level 70 epics, so you should be fine even in level 80 blues.\r\n\r\nAs far as strategy, there's not much to it but I'll offer some insights:\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Kill one of the other bosses to save yourself to the instance (in case you die, so the trash won't reset). I usually killed the first boss because he was on the way, but the last boss probably makes more sense to kill since he will open up the door from the beginning of the instance to the end. I only died a couple times while farming this, when I got feared into another group while clearing trash and my shadowmeld didn't work to drop combat.[/li]\r\n[li]I always cleared the room before summoning. It gives you a lot of room to run around during the fight.[/li]\r\n[li]On trash, you can outrange the fear from the prophets, and you can pop berserk to break the fear if you mess up. Everything else is pretty easy. I usually pulled with hibernate on a bird (if there was one) and entangling roots on any of the mobs besides the prophets, which I killed first. You don't need to CC, but it makes clearing the trash easier. Use barkskin on each trash pack; it should be up every time. If you need to pop cooldowns to survive, don't hesitate to; you can always wait a few minutes for them to come up.[/li]\r\n[li]Once you summon Anzu, he doesn't aggro immediately. I took this to my advantage and cast regrowth on the eagle (haste) and falcon (fire dmg) statues before the fight started.[/li]\r\n[li]Once you engage, keep up a 5-stack of lacerate, FF, and demoralizing roar. Mangle whenever it isn't on cooldown and spam swipe when mangle is on cooldown (but make sure to keep lacerate up). Save your barkskin for when he stuns you, and pop berserk after the first stun wears off (or before the first stun if your rage shoots up fast). Also, make sure you refresh your lacerate stack before he stuns you; the stun has a cast time. If you refresh lacerate before and after the stun, you won't lose the stack.[/li]\r\n[li]As soon as he banishes, cast regrowth on yourself (and more HoTs if necessary). Watch out for his curse; try to interrupt your spell and decurse yourself if possible. After casting regrowth on yourself, run away from him and put a HoT on the falcon statue (it does aoe dmg). Make sure you have time to switch to bear before he stuns you again (if this means you can't put a HoT on the statue, so be it). You can set your focus to him to make the stun cast more obvious. Use demoralizing roar on the adds and spam swipe/maul until they're dead. If something goes wrong during this part (i.e., you mess up), the distance you put between yourself and him will let you heal once or twice more.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\nThat's basically it. Keep up your debuffs and rinse and repeat. If the #$%^ hits the fan, pop survival instincts and frenzied regeneration.

I strongly urge you to pay the 100g to respec feral and do a few dailies after to make up the difference in both time and money.  However, if you're stubborn like me, here's how I do it:\r\n\r\nALWAYS kill the first boss, you will probably wipe somewhere on the trash or the boss and it will all reset otherwise.  He's easy, just nuke, heal and barkskin+hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe trash in Anzu's room can be a real pain.  I wear the pvp trinket to remove fear.  Root the talon lords, sleep the birds, and cyclone the 2nd prophet if there is one.  Nuke the prophets first to avoid the fears.  You can use the coffin in the corner to kite.  They don't have much health but they do a good bit of damage if you don't CC them.  I recommend killing all 5 packs + serpent in the middle.  The 2 bird packs Anzu summons will social aggro them otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen you summon Anzu, move to the wall, he won't attack you right away.  Now HOT up yourself and the eagle, and engage the boss.  You can keep the eagle hotted the whole fight to deal 300 DPS, I use rejuv.  Just make sure you do >50% of the damage to him (~125k).  alternate between bear and tree, and the goal here is to keep demo roar, lacerate, regrowth/rejuv on self, and rejuv on the eagle up at all times.  When you shift to bear stack a couple lifeblooms.  You can use frenzied rejuv about every phase.  Don't ever let your bear health drop below 60% unless your NS is up. The reason for this is that when you shift back to tree he will almost ALWAYS spell bomb you, which needs to be decursed before you cast a hot.  Rehot yourself, you'll probably use innervate around 80% and again at 20%, the mana issue isn't too bad if you're sitting in bear form enough of the fight.  Save barkskin for when you're stunned in tree, otherwise try to shift to bear before the screech finishes casting.  My damage breakdown usually looks like:\r\n\r\n30% hurricane (adds)\r\n23% lacerate\r\n20% thorns\r\n\r\nIf you can keep lacerate up, you don't have to worry about the eagle outdps'ing you.  Take your time and be sure to stay above 60% when you shift back to heal.  He'll crit you for 6-7k.\r\n\r\nTake your time", "date": "2009-03-08T14:52:04-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Here's how I do it.\r\n\r\n1)  Bring your tanking gear, and your frost resist gear\r\n\r\n2)  Stam stack!  I'm a pretty well-geared druid, I'm just over 40k hp self-buffed in bear form in my tanking gear + frost resist gear (which has only +24 stam gems)\r\n\r\n3)  Potions, scrolls, and healthstones help, if you have them!\r\n\r\n4)  Demoralizing roar is your friend!\r\n\r\nI always clear all the trash in Anzu's room, and the first and last bosses of the instance, before attempting the Raven God.  It just makes running back that much faster, and they're downright easy.  Upon summoning the boss, hang back.  He doesn't aggro right away, so put a regrowth on the eagle statue and the falcon statue.  Then charge in, mangle/maul/lacerate to get him to 75%, when he first disappears, and don't forget to keep demoralizing roar up.  Use your barkskin as soon as he first stuns you, and then every time thereafter that he stuns you and it's not on CD.\r\n\r\nPray you resist the curse.  If you don't it gets much harder, as you don't get to heal as much because you waste 2 gcd's decursing (the first being from the heal you stop because you got cursed in the middle of it!)   Still doable, however.  Throw a rejuvenate on the eagle statue, it speeds up downing the birds tremendously.  Then heal yourself.  You don't have to get yourself up to 100%, as you should be able to regain a few % from the birds.  Kite the birds as far away from the boss as you can and swipe-spam them down.  When Anzu comes out of his banished state, he will run around and kill whatever critters are in his aggro range before he comes to you, so you might be able to get off a lifebloom or rejuvenation or something quick.\r\n\r\nProceed to dps the boss down to 33%, when he will banish again.  You'll probably be pretty low on hp at that point, I'm usually around 30%.  Again, pray you resist the curse.  Heal like mad, rejuvenate the eagle, and berserk.  Get the birds down fast!  Heal up as much as you can once they're down, and prepare for the end.  Get the boss down as fast as you can, and pray you hit harder than he does.  Good luck!\r\n\r\nSome points to consider:  The fight takes me about 4 - 4 1/2 minutes.  So either I can burn an early frenzied regeneration, and use it again during the 3rd boss phase, or I can use it during the 2nd boss phase.  Demoralizing roar helps quite a bit, so use it!

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 37, "id": 729539, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Phinx", "body": "How to solo Anzu as a balance druid: \r\n(By a resto druid that has no clue about balance druids)\r\n\r\nI dont have any feral gear, and found that hotting the Eagle for 45 minutes was way too boring, so I decided to give it a shot as Moonkin anyway. I used my usual Boomkin PvP spec, so it wasnt optimal for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat I did however, was changing two of my major glyphs to Lifebloom and Rejuvnation for some extra healing.\r\n\r\nA checklist of what you'll need before you head into Sethekk as Moonkin:\r\n\r\n - [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=46376]Flask of the Frost Wyrm[/url] (Extra healing and damage, and its not so pricey now that its only 1 hr)\r\n - A few stacks of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40093]Indestructible Potions[/url] 3500 extra armor is a ton of mitigation, especially when in caster form\r\n\r\nI dont have Moonkin gear either. So I used the only gear I have, resto PvP gear.\r\nMy stats buffed with flask,indestructible pot and MotW in Moonkin form:\r\n\r\n2682 SP\r\n25 haste rating\r\n12,40% crit\r\n21158 armor \r\n21900 HP\r\n14800 Mana\r\n236 MP5 while casting\r\n\r\nSo, now to the actual fight. Start off with stealthing to Ikiss, and kill him before you kill anything else. Killing him will open the shortcut to his room in case you should die, saving you a lot of time. It also gives you space to kite.\r\n\r\nStart killing off the packs one by one from his room. If there are birds in the pack, hibernate them. Root another moob and kill the rest.  Prophets should be your #1 kill priority, as they fear, but keep in mind that you can outrange their fear. Its has a very short range, if you keep moving you should never be feared.  Dotting and running works great, in the empty room of Ikiss you can also use Starfall without any troubles, and a fear wont kill you. Typhoon is great here.\r\n\r\nThe only hard trash is the Ravenguards by the entrance to Anzu's room. They hit like a truck, you simply cannot tank them. Start off by pulling one with Starfire and root the other.  Use your Treants on the Ravenguard that isnt rooted, and move backwards while your treants nuke the Ravenguard, dot him up. Go catform and dash away, or use Nature's Grasp to gain some distance while you finish him off. Just remember to root the second Ravenguard that will come for you, they burst pretty hard and Barkskin wont save you. Typhoon works on them, which can be a lifesaver.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now you've cleared all the trash and Ikiss, when you know the packs it will take 15 minutes tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nP1: (100-66%)\r\nBefore you get in combat use a Indestructible Potion, so you can use a second when the 2 minutes are up. I usually start off with a regrowth on all the bird statues, drinking to full (takes 3 secs), then regrowthing and rejuvnating myself, go Moonkin, pull and pop Treants right off the bat. The reason I do this is so they get off CD to the last 33%, when you really need em.\r\nAnzu should drop to 66% really fast, you shouldnt go out of Moonkin form this first phase, as you wont have lost more than 6-7k HP with prehots at most.\r\n\r\nNote that you cannot kite Anzu. He will just reset if you pull him too far from his spawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nP2: (First wave of birds)\r\nIt will take a few seconds before the birds attack you. Use this time to throw up a few hots. Regrowth and Rejuvnation is great here, long hots that will last thru this phase. Be aware that Anzu can still stun you.\r\n\r\nWatch out for [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=40303]Spell Bomb[/url]. For me, Anzu usually uses it the first time when P2 starts. Instantly cancel your cast and decurse. The birds arent a big threat really. They hit for 200ish in Moonkin, and are easily AoEed down with Starfall and Hurricane, just wait till you have the Owlkin Frenzy proc so you dont waste half your hurricane.  \r\n\r\nP3: (66-33%)\r\nAnzu will rush you once all birds are down.  At this point I pop Barkskin, and start hotting up. I usually go Lifebloom - > Regrowth - > Lifebloom - > Rejuvnation - > Lifebloom - > Moonkin. \r\n\r\nAt this point you are probably OOM, if not earlier. Use Innervate, and you might need to refresh your Indestructible Potion. Getting hit in caster form without it means 4-5k hits, which translates into a quick death. In this phase you have no offensive cooldowns to use.Only your normal damage spells. You might need to heal twice or more, get as many hots as possible on before you go back to Moonkin, you dont want to waste mana, you really need to catch up when your HP is low. I wouldnt fall below 10-12k health before healing, then it starts to get really dangerous if you get unlucky with stuns and Spell Bombs when you pop out to heal.\r\n\r\nWhen you see him casting Paralyzing Screech (5 second cast time), 6 second AoE stun, throw a few hots on, and go back to Moonkin before its finished. If you use [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=46081]Titan-forged Rune of Audacity[/url] (I did), you can trinket one stun.\r\n\r\nP4: (Second wave of birds)\r\nObviously same as first, but you need to keep enough mana to finish the last 33%. You wont have Starfall here, so wait for Owlkin Frenzy and Hurricane them down. You'll want to keep yourself at near full HP before the birds are dead and Anzu resumes his attacks, so hot yourself [i]before[/i] the birds attack you. If you go caster form to heal while you have the birds on you the damage might become a problem, especially if Anzu decides to stun you, and you also risk not getting the birds down before Anzu releases, which means you die.\r\n\r\nP5: (33-0%)\r\nWhen Barkskin is up, use it. When Treants are back up, use them. Starfall, use it. Just remember to keep yourself up, and you'll down him. When the Treants are back up he goes down like a rock, just be sure to keep your health pool up. When you pop out to heal, throw up Regrowth, Rejuvnation and 3x Lifebloom. I went OOM here, and had to wait for mana regen to pop my Treants. Luckily I had full hots on me at this time, so he went down with me at around 7k health and 1000 mana left.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my first kill so the strat isnt perfect for sure. I had around 11-12 tries before getting him down, but I think the next time it should take 1-3 tries tops, as it doesnt feel very random. Scrolls of Intellect / Spirit / Stamina would also be very helpful, but there wasnt any at a reasonable price available at the AH. Some PvE gear for mana regen would be nice too, but I wouldnt drop below 20k health.\r\n\r\n[url=http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Ravencrest&n=Phinx]Here[/url] is my armory profile, should show me in the gear that I used as I dont really have much else. My Moonkin spec might be slightly stupid, but I dont have a clue about Moonkins and only use it for fun in BGs / Duels and the odd heroic.\r\n\r\nGonna fraps it also, dont know how interesting it is but it should make the strat more clear than this mess.\r\n\r\nHappy farming = )\r\n\r\n[i]In before TL;DR, wall of text etc.[/i]", "date": "2009-05-27T19:09:26-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

After banish phase, pop Cold Snap, use elemental and Icy veins again. Nuke to 2nd banish phase, evocate, bandage pot/gem if needed (I use glyph of evocation). Again wait a bit for images to recharge. If he starts casting Paralyzing Screech, pop Ice Block so you don't get unwanted dmg. After he exits 2nd banish phase, pop images and hope you don't die. Nuke hard and try to avoid being near him when hes killing your images. Don't forget to remove curse.\r\n\r\nI'll post an update when I get him down.

After 82 tries, I've gotten the reins for a shadow priest friend.  Here's how we've been doing it:\r\n\r\n1. Buff up and clear the entrance hallway.\r\n2. Position your friend in that hole in the middle of the floor in the first room.  If the trash pull to the right of the door has a habit of jumping your buddy on the way, I recommend clearing that pull before your friend goes to sit in the hole.\r\n3. Stealth through the instance, directly to [b]Ikiss[/b].\r\n4. Make war on Ikiss, opening the shortcut and allowing your friend to come up and join you.\r\n5. Backtrack through Anzu's room to clear trash; it's faster and easier with two people, especially if one can break fear on the other.  Put the moonstone in just before you pull the last pull and kite them behind the box in the corner, he will be about done talking by the time you've cleared the last pull.\r\n6. Kick Anzu in the face, cross fingers for reins.\r\n\r\nEach run took me about 20 minutes between initial buffing and my frustrated war stomp on his corpse when he gave us yet another boomstick or talon.

He was originally a benign creature, but sometime around 2000BC, stories formulated that he rebelled against the gods.\r\n\r\nThe god Enlil had a number of objects that he would bestow some of his power into and which would then become a source of power for the gods. In Enlil's case, one of his main sources of power was his insignia, which included a list of all the \"destinies\" he had decided his subjects would accomplish (called a Tablet of Destinies). One day while the god was bathing, he took off his insignia and the register of destinies and put it aside. Anzu, who happened to be Enlil's guard, watched the god with envy and decided to make his move.\r\n\r\n    \"[i]I shall take the gods\u00b4 Tablet of Destinies for myself,\r\n    And control the orders for all the gods,\r\n    And shall possess the throne and be master of the rites!\r\n    I shall direct every one of the Igigi![/i]\"\r\n    He plotted opposition in his heart\r\n    And at the chamber\u00b4s entrance from which he often gazed,\r\n    He waited for the start of the day.\r\n    While Enlil was bathing in the holy water,\r\n    Stripped and with his crown laid down on the throne,\r\n    He gained the Tablet of Destinies for himself,\r\n    Took away the Enlil-power. Rites were abandoned,\r\n    Anzu flew off and went into\r\n    Radiance faded, silence reigned\r\n\r\nEnlil was enraged by this action and called a meeting among all the gods to find a champion who would fight against Anzu, regain the Tablet of Destinies, and set the word right again. After a number of gods refused the task, believing it to be impossible, Ninurta agreed to the mission.\r\n\r\nSoon, a battle ensued between Ninurta and Anzu. Ninurta called upon 'the seven winds' and shot at him with arrows, but the great bird held the Tablet of Destinies, which deflected all attacks against him.\r\n\r\n    As Anzu shouted at it:\r\n    \"[i]You, shaft that came, return to your reed thicket!\r\n    Bow frame, back to your copse!\r\n    Bow string, back to the ram\u00b4s gut! Feathers, return to the birds![/i]\"\r\n    He was holding the gods\u00b4 Tablet of Destinies in his hand,\r\n    And they influenced the string of the bow, the arrows did not come near his body\r\n    Deadly silence came over the battle and conflict ceased.\r\n    Weapons stopped and did not capture Anzu amid the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen that approach failed, Ninurta tried a different strategy designed to tire out the bird - he went after Anzu's feathers, cutting them, and then pierced him with arrows. When the bird fell, he cut his throat.\r\n\r\n    Anzu grew weary and in the clash of tempests shed his pinions.\r\n    He (Ninurta) took a throw-stick to follow his arrows,\r\n    And cut off his pinions, detached both right and left.\r\n    He (Anzu) saw his wings and emitted his utterance.\r\n    But as he shouted 'Wing to wing' a shaft came up at him\r\n    A dart passed through his very heart.\r\n    He (Ninurta) made an arrow pass through pinion and wing,\r\n    A dart passed through heart and lungs,\r\n    He slew the mountains, inundated their proud pastures,\r\n    Inundated the broad earth in his fury,\r\n    Inundated the midst of the mountains, slew wicked Anzu,\r\n    And warrior Ninurta regained the Tablets of Destinies for his own hand.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/delirium/articleview.asp?Post=95", "date": "2010-09-21T07:22:55-05:00", "rating": 64, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

This was indeed not a trivial fight in ICC25 gear with a freshly built frost spec, and I only got it on the second attempt.\n\nHow I did it:\n\nPositioned water elemental behind Hawk Spirit, 90 degrees across the room to the left. I stayed in the doorway. Let pet pull and get a few shots in. Nuked Anzu for all I was worth from max range until adds spawned. Each phase without adds runs like this: Nuke Frostbolt, Frostfire Bolt when Brain Freeze procs, and Deep Freeze whenever it's off cooldown and Fingers of Frost procs. (This is the typical frost rotation.)\n\nAdd phases: First phase I popped Mirror Image (because I forgot there were two phases) and they kept the birds busy while I rained a couple of Blizzards on them. Second add phase I had to get a bit more creative. Hit Frost Nova to get some range and then Blizzard a couple of times. Cone of Cold for any that get back in range. Anzu stuns you shortly after these phases begin, so you have to be able to ride it out. Make sure Ice Barrier is always up, and don't waste your Deep Freeze cooldown on the adds.\n\nFinal phase: He Cycloned me at the start of this phase and went after my pet. After that ended I was taking damage so I hit Ice Block to let my pet gain some more aggro and let my Ice Barrier cooldown run down. (I was reserving Cold Snap in case something went really wrong, but I didn't need it.) Then Blink for range and nuke until dead.\n\nHad Evocation, Ice Barrier, Frostbolt and Deep Freeze (among others not relevant here) glyphed.\n\nThings that might have helped: Cold Snap (as mentioned before) and PvP trinket (not sure if this works though). I popped Lifeblood (herbalism ability) once. A healing pot might also have been useful. I didn't hit Evocation on my successful attempt; I tried it on my first attempt but it was a complete waste of time and resulted in the wipe.\n\nEDIT: Downrated?
