Closest ones first. Use knockbacks & stuns. Death grip also works.\n\nPhase 2\n\nSulfuras Smash remains from Phase 1, lava traps and knockback are gone.\n-Split raid on both sides of room, empty in middle.\n-Dont stand in Engulfing Flames\n-When Ragranos uses Molten seeds, move to the center, pop survivability cooldowns and aoe until the adds that spawn are dead. During second seeds, you will get Sulfuras Smash at the same time. Easiest way to deal with this is to go close to the edge of Raggy's pool and the smash will simply go over you.\n\nTransition 2\n\n-Kill adds before they reach the hammer, just like in transition 1.\n-2 big adds spawn in addition to smaller adds. Burn these while moving them around, if you get the debuff, move anywhere where ANY of the adds are not moving towards.\n-Small adds > Big adds.\n\nPhase 3\n\nSulfuras Smash and  Engulfing Flames will remain from previous phases.\n-Living Meteors will spawn continually, which follow players around and kill them (and anyone nearby) if they reach them. Attack the meteors to knock them back. Split the raid in half like in p2 and knock the meteors toward the middle. Once there are too many meteors, start kiting them if needed.\n-If the meteors hit lava waves, [i]something [/i]happens to them. As far as I know, its only for the sake of the achievement.\n\nHeroic:\n\nP1:\n\n-Similar to normal. Time magma traps carefully to prevent any deaths.\n\nTransition 1:\n\n-Same as normal, except different spawn locations (?). The more death grips/typhoons etc. you have, the better.\n\nP2: \n\n-Easiest way to handle Molten Seeds is to group up in mid, wait for them to start flying in the air, then have EVERYONE move away. No one takes damage, all the seeds are clustered, but timing is crucial. Simply aoe/typhoon them down afterwards. If not working, simply single target them down. Will take longer though.\n-Engulfing flames comes 4 times in a row for 3 seconds at each part, stand near the edges everytime to prevent unneeded damage/deaths.\n\nTransition 2:\n\n-Same as normal/transition 1, remember no failing with the debuff! If possible, keep one son of flame up while you kill scions. \n\nP3: \n\n- Heroism either as soon as raggy comes up or after scions are dead. Same as normal + the new engulfing flames. \"Chill time\" before P4 considering tactics. HUGE dps requirement. 140 seconds to go from 40->10% to avoid extra living meteors from spawning. If Scions are still up when raggy comes back, only cleave them down. All DPS needs to focus rag.\n\nEdit: With the nerfed HP, you can hit P4 with just one meteor. Much easier in 10man than in 25.\n\nP4:\n\n-Designate at least 2 (3rd can be a melee backup. Only one in 10man) players to extinguish dreadflames as soon as they spawn, do NOT let them spread.

Handle them as long as you can, at the end dont bother trying to keep the whole room clear, simply have a path to the next Breadth of Frost and a clear zone where your raid needs to be.\n-Create groups that stand on the edges of breadth of frost. Max 8 players per group (should be 7. Thats for 25, 10man is ez), triangle style on the edges. You should never see Magma Geyser.\n-Once a second Breadth of frost spawns, kite a living meteor to the first one, kill it and quickly move the next Breatdh.\n-When Empower Sulfuras casts, have your current tank kite raggy to the entangling roots.", "date": "2011-06-09T17:45:32-05:00", "rating": 95, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Also to add on, if anyone on the quest chain for [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=71086]Dragonwrath[/url], this fight is even harder, as that player and all around them take a large constant damage from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=101228]this[/url].

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 6, "id": 1455827, "nreplies": 5, "sticky": 0, "user": "310125", "body": "[b]Normal Mode Strategy[/b]\n\n[b]Phase 1[/b]\nRagnaros is two-tanked, and will put a stacking fire DoT on its current aggro target. Tanks must switch off near 3-4 stacks and use cooldowns towards the end of their turn.\nEvery 30 seconds, Ragnaros will cast Sulfuras Smash. He will face a random player and hit the area they were standing in after two seconds of cast time. The location of the smash is given away by three lava pools formed together on the spot. When the cast is finished, three lava waves will spawn and move in different directions. (one is in the direction the boss was facing, and the other two will be to the perpendicular sides.) The locations of these smashes will always be within an arc just barely past the edge of the platform in front of Ragnaros. They are easily avoidable by standing diagonal to the direction of the smash or close-up to the boss. Touching the lava wave will knock back the player and place a strong magic DoT on them which will kill them if not dispelled immediately.\nRagnaros will also randomly burst the entire raid, knocking them back a few yards. (Similar to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=46753]Al'Akir[/url]'s [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93261]Wind Burst[/url] but without a cast time.) Players should not be near the edge of the platform or they will get knocked off into the lava. Players must also be aware of this knockback possibly due at the same time a Sulfuras Smash occurs so they do not accidentally get knocked into the lava waves or a trap. [i]This mechanic only occurs during Phase 1.[/i]\nRanged must be fully spread out as a random ranged player will be targeted with a trap on the ground that will damage the entire raid when triggered. It will remain there for the entire fight unless it is activated by a player moving into it. Warlocks with Demonic Portals, Mages with Slowfall, or Priests with Levitate can trigger these without dying. [b]However,[/b] they must be sure the entire raid is topped before doing so as this combined with Ragnaros' random burst will kill someone who is not fully healed.\n\n[b]Phase 1.5[/b]\nAt 70%, Ragnaros will face a random direction in front of him and throw down Sulfuras before submerging. Eight fire elemental adds will spawn in static locations around the perimeter of the platform. If any one of these elementals touches Sulfuras, they will cast [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=100260]Supernova[/url] and blast your entire raid for a lot of damage. This will wipe your raid if you are not fully topped. They start with a movement speed increase which will decrease as their health lowers to 50%. All melee should be separated to their own assigned add to stunlock and burn it down while ranged finish off all adds prioritized by whichever is closest to Sulfuras. These adds cannot be rooted or snared, but they [b]can[/b] be [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=49576]Death Gripped[/url], and knocked back with [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=50516]Typhoon[/url]. When all adds have died or 45 seconds have elapsed in this phase, Ragnaros will reemerge. \n\n[b]Phase 2[/b]\nRagnaros uses a new ability which will also be used in Phase 3. Engulfing Flames will be cast for 3 seconds on a third of the room (separated in lanes: melee, middle, ranged)\nEvery 60 seconds, Ragnaros will spawn lava seeds on random players within the raid. All players must be spread out to avoid the splash damage these seeds cause when placed but remain on one side of the room before they are placed. After all seeds are placed, players must cross over to the other side immediately before these seeds detonate. Damage from all the seeds are based on proximity, so the closer the deadlier. After the explosion, adds will spawn for each one of these seeds and target random players. The raid must stack up to AoE all these adds down before spreading back out for the next wave of seeds. The raid can stack anywhere, but it would be easiest to do so on top of the tank at the very front of the platform to avoid being caught off guard by Sulfuras Smash. However, if any players stagger and are too far back they are likely to get instantly killed by Sulfuras Smash. \n\nThe biggest part of this phase is being in the right place at the right time. When a Sulfuras Smash or Engulfing Flames occurs, players must remain at least 6 yards away from each other when Lava Seeds are coming. These two abilities will also occur when players are stacking up to AoE adds so they must be aware of them coming. The abilities used in this phase are static and sequential, so it's easy to memorize what will happen when. (e.g. Every second lava seed spawn having a Sulfuras Smash happen right after the explosion)\n\n[b]Phase 2.5[/b]\nStarts at 40% HP. The exact same as Phase 1.5 with the addition of two Lava Scions, each one spawning on separate sides of the room which must be tanked. All players must kill their elemental adds quickly as before with the exception of the furthest one to buy time to kill both Lava Scions before Ragnaros reemerges. Chain grips and knockbacks on the last add to use the full duration of the phase while burning down one of the scions to free a tank for Ragnaros in Phase 3. \n\n[b]Phase 3[/b]\nSulfuras Smash and Engulfing Flames are still used in this phase. Very large meteors will now start spawning as a soft enrage in this fight to chase random players. The spawn location is given away with a graphic similar to Hellfire which everyone nearby must move away from. They are extremely slow, and can be knocked back every 5 seconds by doing direct damage to them. However, it should only be hit if it's in danger of touching the player. Meteors do not stay on the same player and may switch to a different one at any time, so it's important to keep distance from all active meteors. Collision with the meteor will cause it to explode, killing the colliding player and everyone within 8 yards. As this phase persists, meteors will keep spawning and chasing more players so Ragnaros must be killed as fast as possible.\n\nAt 10% HP, Ragnaros retreats and awaits you to defeat him on Heroic.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] Changed tank info & last line.", "date": "2011-06-30T14:53:54-05:00", "rating": 60, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You are wrong about the tank switching...the debuff only lasts 20 seconds, so it's normally done at 3-4 stacks.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 8, "id": 1461322, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Manbewbs", "body": "I will be explaining the 10 man regular mode encounter of this fight, this is an overview of the whole fight but I will cover some tanking tips as it was my job and know it the most.\n\nThe encounter will need 2 tanks minimum for both raid sizes. The enrage timer is 12 minutes. Ragnaros hits hard on tanks.\n\nThe following two abilities will persist throughout the whole fight aside from the two transition phases where he will be submerged.\nSulfuras Smash will happen, an ability that will show up as 3 circles clumped together on the ground, and smash his hammer on the specified location. Getting hit by the direct ability is a one shot. 3 lava waves will spew out from where the hammer hit, much like Sartharion's lava walls except much smaller but faster. The directions that the walls spawn from will be from the tip of the specified location (outwards pointing to the nearest edge of the platform) and the two sides. It will never point towards Ragnaros himself and will always point in the same directions. If you do happen to get hit by the lava walls, it will hit for about moderate damage and apply a dot on you which needs to be dispelled. It is completely avoidable and should be. Also note that the area where he smashed his hammer will have a ground effect AoE which will do some damage.\nAnother ability Ragnaros does is a stacking DoT called Burning Wound on the tank, this is basically a tank swap. Tanks should taunt immediately after their stacks fall off, as it has a 20 second duration. A tip for the pull is to let the main tank use his threat CD's, and once it wears off tank two taunts to maximize TPS. After that both tanks should taunt off each other immediately.\n\nPhase 1: 100%-70%\n\nDuring phase 1 he will cast hand of Ragnaros, knocking back all players in range of him and do a small amount of damage that cannot be avoided unless ranged (don't bother, you'll have to be off the platform completely).\n\nHe will also cast wrath of Ragnaros and blast a random raid member and inflict moderate damage, blasting them backwards. Basically spread out to avoid multiple players getting hit.\n\nThese two abilities are similar to Al'akir's wind burst.\n\nThe key ability in phase 1 that Ragnaros will use is magma trap, but unlike shadow trap on Lich King this trap will need to be activated or else you will have multiple traps on the platform which will make things chaotic in phase 3. The initial cast will look like a orange swirly heading towards the direction (underneath a player) and needs to be avoided. It will also have a ground effect similar to a shadow crash on general Vezax in Ulduar or the trash packs before the last boss in OK.\nWhen the trap gets detonated, it will do moderate damage to the entire raid. Think of a crackle except less deadly but more often.\nThe way you handle these traps before they get overwhelming is to send a capable ranged player to step on these traps to detonate. You do not get any parachute or slow fall of what sort by default, so you must use a class's ability, such as Slow fall from priests, Blink from mages, disengage from hunters, etc. Coordinate with your healers when you do this, a badly timed detonate may cause a lot of strain or a death.\nTanks should use a CD when the trap gets detonated, Shield wall, BH trinket, anything that reduces damage is great as you won't have a chance to use them much unless healers are falling behind.\n\nThe combination of the multiple knock backs, magma traps, and sulfuras smash can be deadly at times, as if you get knocked back into either a trap, smash, or lava wave it can be a bad start.\n\nPhase 1.5: the phase shift\n\nDuring this phase, Ragnaros himself will not do any damage to tanks, and there not be much damage coming out to the raid. This is ideal time to regenerate mana for healers.\n\nRagnaros will once again, smash his hammer on the ground but will not cause any lava waves. You can tell where his hammer is going to be placed from the 8 beams that will be visible, indicating where 8 adds will spawn. He can place his hammer on the left side, center, or middle. You can tell where it will be before he places them. If 2 beams are to the left and 6 to the right, the hammer will be placed on the left. If it is split (4:4) it will be in the center. If 6 beams are to the left and 2 to the right, it will spawn to the right. These adds don't have any threat and dps may wish to dps as they please. These adds are considered elementals and paladins should glyph into holy wrath to stun them because of the following reason.\nWhen the elementals reach the hammer, it will cause about 100k damage and can easily be a wipe. If everyone is at full HP, a wipe can be prevented but don't expect it. Just kill them before they reach the hammer. The key thing about these adds is the lower their HP is, the slower they are until they're at a point where they move like a snail. To prevent any speedy runs to the hammer, stun them as soon as they come out with a long stun, such as Concussion blow, Hammer of Justice, etc. Split up DPS, with 2 on the left, 2 on the right, and your most capable DPS in the center. DK's can death grip them if one's getting dangerously close, and knock backs work, but aren't recommended for the [b]second[/b] transition.\nWhen the adds die, they'll explode but it's best to have melee stick on them and heal through the small damage.\nDo not leave a Son of Flame active as if Ragnaros comes back up and ones still alive he'll instantly wipe the raid.\n\nPhase 2: 70%-40%\n\nRagnaros will emerge again, but this time there will be no more knock backs, and no more traps. Instead introduced are two new mechanics. \n\nThere will be Engulfing Flames, similar to Valiona's engulfing flames which cover one third of the ground towards the end of Theralion's ground phase.\nTanks must always be in melee range or Ragnaros will start casting on you, which is a lot more damage than melee. The engulfing flame makes it hard to stay in melee range. I found the initial flame easy to avoid but died to the ground effect after. If you look closely at the flames, you will see that they are many circles on the ground that makes it, making a long chain of circles of fire. If you stand in between a circle's top and another circle's top, you can just get in enough for melee range. If you have graphics turned on and you are comfortable then you may not need to do this.\nAnother ability he will cast is Molten seeds. These seeds will spawn on players and do moderate AoE damage. Spread out. The key to this is that because when the seeds explode and do damage, the farther away you are the less damage it'll do. Pretty much have all the players spread out on the right and left sides of the whole platform, no one should be standing in the middle. The tricky part about spreading out is that you will sometimes have an engulfing flame right before seeds, making it tricky to spread after the engulfing flames before the seeds. The same goes for Sulfuras Smash's lava walls.\nWhen the seeds blow up, it is a good time to use raid CD's, AMZ is amazing, AM from holy paladins, DG, RC, SLT, and PW:B are all great for this as you will be stacking for when they do. The reason you want to stack is because after the seeds blow up, adds spawn with low HP and they need to be AoE'd down, a tank cannot pick them up as after spawning they fixate on someone. Best for groups with hunters is to stun all the adds and let them go out to AoE. When the stuns wear off hopefully they're all dead.", "date": "2011-07-05T09:55:32-05:00", "rating": 34, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-07-05T10:18:36-05:00", 2, "Manbewbs"]}
{"commentv2": 1, "number": 9, "id": 1461325, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Manbewbs", "body": "Cont Phase 2-\n\nA good place to stack is right in front of Ragnaros, and the center of the platform as he will still be doing damage to tanks and because either Engulfing Flames or Sulfuras Smash will happen during the time the raid stacks. When Sulfuras Smash happens, just tuck in further into Ragnaros, making sure you're not standing in lava as there's a little gap between him and the hammer.\nAfter they're all dead, rinse and repeat. We found the first and third stack \"phase\" to be Engulfing Flames, and the second one the Smash. We did not get a fourth one so I cannot comment on it, although it's logical it is a Smash.\n\nPhase 2.5: transition phase\n\nExact same as the first transition aside from one new debuff and a new type of add, Blazing Trail, if it's on a player it will leave a fire trail on the ground and if you stand still with the debuff you will be standing in the stacking fire, obviously not good. This fire trail also heals the little elemental adds, thus making them faster and most likely making a wipe. Stand on the edge of the platform and DPS adds from behind to negate the risk of them healing.\nA new type of an add spawns that have a lot more HP (2 million ish I think?) that must be tanked and killed. The second transition is ideal to pop Bloodlust/Heroism to get these adds down, though prioritizing little adds over large ones. They spawn from the black circles (rock formation on the ground all throughout the encounter). Burn them down once the adds are dead.\nThese adds are tauntable and should be to switch off on Burning stacks of Ragnaros through phase 3.\n\nPhase 3: 40%-10%\n\nEngulfing Flames still persist from phase two during phase three. There is a new mechanic introduced again, this time a flaming Meteor. These Living Meteors have a lot of HP and should not be killed. When they spawn a small hellfire will indicate the location. This meteor will fixate on a random member, not the tanks as far as I saw, and follow them. A yellow line will be connecting the player and the meteor, and the player will have a yellow arrow above their head. If this does reach you, you will explode the meteor, one shot anyone near you and yourself, and get blown off. Luckily you can avoid it reaching you by damaging the meteor and it will knock it back from the player that damaged it. Shortly after it will fixate on a different player and start again. You cannot spam knock him back though, as it gets a debuff after you knock it which prevents it from being knocked back for 5 seconds.\nDuring this phase more and more meteors will spawn until you eventually become overwhelmed.\nHealers should hit the boulder themselves with Moonfire, SW:D, Judgement, or Earth Shock.\n\nThat pretty much concludes my in depth explanation for Ragnaros!

In terms of placement, first we tried gathering in a circle around the center using the floor pattern as a guide.  In later attempts we tried stacking on one side of the room and running to the opposite side.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, if we got Engulfing Flames in the center of the room at the same time as the seeds, it was pretty much a wipe since the ranged and tanks were divided and unable to stack for healing and damage reduction - especially if we were using the circle strategy.  EF was particularly annoying for the 2nd seed when the room would get divided by flames, followed by seed, followed by the hammer wave.  No matter which configuration we used it ended badly.  Are you just screwed if you have seeds and a center EF at the same time?\r\n\r\nGoing back to formations, using the center worked decently until EF divided the room and no one could stack anymore.  So we tried stacking the raid on a side and then moving to the other as we got seeds.  This seemed like a messier approach since people were scattered in terms of how far they had crossed the room by the time the seeds went off, so that heals and damage reductions weren't getting everyone.  Is there a minimum damage dealt by the seeds so that there's a distance we should have been stopping at sooner?  We also still had a difficulties with the EF again, and getting everyone to the front on the 2nd seed to avoid the hammer.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on formations and how to deal with EF/seed at the same time would be *greatly* appreciated!

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 27, "id": 1536311, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "citrique", "body": "Heroic is a somewhat different encounter than normal, especially after the rather sweeping nerfs to the normal version.\n\nOur guild ended up 3-healing the 25-man version of the encounter for a kill.\n\nPhase 1 is mostly the same. The major differences are that detonating a Magma Trap causes everyone in the raid to receive a Magma Trap Vulnerability debuff which causes them to take 50% additional damage from detonated traps for 45 seconds. What this means is that you cannot detonate a trap for 45 seconds afterward, causing you to slowly accumulate additional traps that will persist after the phase has ended. Ideally this number will be as close to 0 as possible, in our case it was 1.\n\nWhat we did was had ranged DPS mostly stay on the left side of the boss along with the tanks, with melee on the right so they could DPS the boss from behind and avoid parries. A couple ranged (with legendaries) stood behind the melee on the right. A shaman healed the melee group solo. When the third and fourth traps were about to be cast, ranged DPS would venture towards the back of the platform to cause the trap to spawn there, then move back in so Hand of Ragnaros could not knock them off. The trap(s) which persists beyond phase 1 needs to be placed as close to the edge as possible so it is avoidable and out of the way for subsequent phases. If it is placed close enough to the edge of the platform, it can be ignored for the remainder of the fight.\n\nDPS in phase 1 is primarily focused on pushing the transition before you get a fifth trap. Otherwise DPS doesn't matter an awful lot and a focus on survivability is best taken.\n\nDuring the P1-P2 transition, the major difference is that Sons of Flame reaching the hammer will instantly wipe the raid upon detonation (400K damage or so) and they have a huge amount more health. We assigned Death Knights to grip Sons closest to the hammer on the \"long\" side of a split (hammer to the left or right) with moonkin/ele shaman knockbacks for the \"short\" side. The transition phase is the roughest for healers with lots of random damage from Lava Bolts. Tranquility was used to catch up at the end of the phase before Rag re-emerged.\n\nDuring Phase 2 the major differences are that Molten Seeds/Elementals work differently. Elementals gain a buff which causes them to be immune to CC and do more damage, and they gain an additional instance of this buff for every other Elemental which is within a few yards of them. Therefore there are two ways to deal with these - the raid spreads out very far apart and each player deals with their own add where it spawns, or the raid stacks up and moves as one large group just before the Seeds land, then AOEs the adds down after they spawn before they reach anyone. We used the latter method for 25-man, the former method is more viable for 10-man. Ragnaros will cast \"World in Flames\" after every add wave, which works like the Heigan Dance. It's best for players to stand roughly inbetween where the bands of Engulfing Flames can spawn so their movement is minimized to avoid this.\n\nWe blew our one extra trap up after the first Engulfing Flames of P2 was done and covered it with Spirit Link.\n\nDPS on Ragnaros himself is most important in Phase 3. When Ragnaros casts World in Flames, he is unable to cast any other abilities or do a phase transition. Therefore, what we did was we slowed DPS around the 44% mark and waited for him to do another seed/add wave (the third). After killing the adds, we then got him as close to 40.6% (the mark where he submerges) as possible and waited for him to start casting World in Flames. When he starts this cast, you have the entire 9 seconds of him casting it to burn as much of his HP as possible, then he will start the submerging dialogue and you will have another 8 seconds of DPS before he goes under. Doing this can shave 5-6% off of his health which is damage you do not need to do in phase 3.\n\nThe second phase transition is the same as the first in regards to Sons and Lava Scions. The goal here is to kill both Scions before Ragnaros re-emerges. Any Sons of Flame which are still alive after he re-emerges will detonate regardless of where they are after 3 seconds. What we did was we would leave one Son alive while burning the Scions down, then kill the Son just as he re-emerged. Ideally both Scions will be dead as he re-emerges.\n\nPhase 3 works the same as normal aside from World in Flames. The ideal goal in this phase is to have as few meteors as possible, thus P3 being a DPS race. Our goal was 1 meteor. We burned the boss and used Bloodlust after the first World in Flames cast ended. When the meteor spawned, Death Knights knocked it back away from the raid so that it could be ignored as much as possible during the phase. When Ragnaros reaches 10% health, he cannot cast any other abilities (including summoning more meteors) and all damage done to him will reduce the amount of health he starts with in phase 4, so he should be burned until submerging.\n\nThere is a ~15 second window between P3 and P4 where Concentration Potions or other abilities that would be otherwise dangerous can be used.\n\nNote that as P4 starts, you CANNOT approach the boss until his legs appear coming up from the ground, if you run towards him before this you will fall in the lava and die.\n\nPhase 4: When the Druid NPCs spawn, they freeze any meteors on the platform. These should be knocked back to the edge. Ragnaros will then emerge from the lava starting at 50% health minus whatever you were able to knock off below 10% of his HP before he submerged. The raid should assign 3 main positions where groups of 7 people will stack in a triangle around Breadth of Frost to avoid Molten Geysers forming. Any player who gets Fixate from a Meteor at this point will need to kite it around the outside of the raid for as long as possible before knocking it away and returning to the raid stack to drop their Superheated stacks. Players returning must move straight in towards their group and not try to come in sideways between two groups as this can trigger a Geyser and wipe the raid. When the second Breadth spawns, the raid moves to it, and the player with Fixate will bring the meteor into the first Breadth where it will become frozen and can be killed. It is imperative that this Meteor is killed, Meteors that become frozen take 50% more damage and should die within a few GCDs.\n\nRagnaros himself will channel \"Empower Sulfuras\" causing any melee attacks he does to do 500K damage to the entire raid. A warrior tank is rather ideal here. When the Entrapping Roots spawn, the tank must wait for Ragnaros to start channeling his Empower cast, then must move to the other side of the roots so the boss walks into them and is stunned before being able to melee with this buff. Stunning him / kiting him causes the Empower buff to fall off. Heroic Leap, life grip, Stampeding Roar / a swiftness potion are best used here so the tank can accomplish this. The remainder of the phase is repeating this while Dreadflame extinguishers (classes that can do a lot of damage on the move such as Hunters, or classes with high movement speed such as feral druids/shamans) work to keep paths clear around Breadth and roots spawns. The \"enrage\" is running out of room on the platform due to Dreadflame spreading.\n\nThe major factors for downing this boss are\n\n- High DPS from everyone in P3/P4\n- Minimize damage taken from Engulfing Flames\n- Good positioning\n- Good RNG with P4 spawns", "date": "2011-10-06T08:45:44-05:00", "rating": 15, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-10-06T08:53:54-05:00", 1, "citrique"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 32, "id": 1555288, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Iroared", "body": "To reiterate some things, specifically for 10-man version (heroic).\n\nPhase 1 - the only noticeable difference is the debuff from detonating a trap; we usually had 2 traps left over. One was usually detonated somewhere in phase 2, and the other before phase 4.\nTransition - sons of flame spawn very differently from normal. They spawn very randomly, e.g. you can get a hammer on the left and 5 elementals next to it, or sometimes only one elemental would spawn near the hammer. The goal is to be quick on distributing people between the sides. The sons themselves only have slightly higher health than in normal mode - around 200k.\n\nPhase 2 - engulfing flames are replaced by world in flames, which casts a shorter version of engulfing flames several times in a row. As soon as the animation for the new flames starts, you can move to the space that was previously covered in flames. Its very easy to move out of, even if you didn't stand at the edge. The ticks don't one-shot you, but they hurt healer's mana, which is very important here.\nAdds from seeds have increased damage when they are close together. We ended up dealing with it just by spreading out slightly once they come out - we could still AoE them and they don't hurt that much.\nTransition - same as the previous one, with added Lava Scions, which tanks have to remember to pick up, hit a couple times, and ignore until the sons are dealt with. Leave one son with low health until the scions are dead or until ragnaros re-emerges, at which point the son has to be quickly killed or it will explode. You really don't want scions alive when the next phase starts, as DPS is very important here.\n\nPhase 3 - the only difference from normal is world in flames, same as phase 2. DPS here is really important, this is the place to use bloodlust/heroism (we actually had our hunter spec BM for this fight, since we don't have a shaman and the mage wasn't able to play for some time). The goal is to get him to 10% before the second meteor, which was really tough timing for us (the first meteor should spawn at about 20% in a successful pull). We always kept trying when the second meteor spawned, but we never got far into phase 4 this way.\n\nPhase 4 - the most important part is getting the meteor(s) out of the way. This is when most defensive cooldowns will be used. The raid has to be precise at positioning within breadths (note: in 4.3 the geysers were removed and you can just stack together). We didn't bother with making people run out to kite meteors, usually knocking it back on cooldown was enough to keep it away until the second breadth spawns.\nOnce the meteor is down, it should stabilize as you don't have to be in a hurry anymore and people can stay around in the old breadth until the way is clear. The main challenge at this point (other than not being overrun by dreadflames) is for tanks to quickly react to roots spawns. The roots will often spawn right next to ragnaros, and he has to be moved away until Empowered Sulfuras (which happens in 8 seconds, unless he stops to cast more dreadflames). If this is not done, the roots will be wasted and you will have to taunt-kite the boss for 10 seconds, which means a lot of wasted tank cooldowns for surviving superheated and additional stress. A good strategy is for the tank not currently on the boss to move out a few seconds before the roots spawn, ready to taunt the boss if he needs to be moved quickly. Once roots spawned and the boss is away from them, the other tank runs behind the roots and gets ready to taunt. The first tank has to remember to stop attacking.\nDreadflames in 10-man is only handled by one person with cloudburst, in our case it was a balance druid who spent most of phase 4 in cat form for faster movement.\nThis phase is very prone to randomness, e.g. first dreadflames spawning near cloudburst can allow the extinguisher to get rid of them completely, whereas if they spawn far away they can quickly get out of control. If breadths spawn in the middle of dreadflames, you're out of luck, you will have to wait for the next one and hope its close by. On our first kill we had very lucky spawns, with 3 breadths spawning in almost the same place.", "date": "2011-10-27T16:19:01-05:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-12-24T03:20:27-06:00", 2, "Iroared"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 37, "id": 1577563, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Namnalia", "body": "Some tips we wiped 97 times for before finally getting our kill yesterday on the heroic ragnaros(10m):\n\nGeneral: Don't waste your time with bad setups. We benched our resto shaman and dps warrior from the very beginning and had our feral dd respec to balance. It may be possible to beat the encounter with unusual setups, but given the time needed to learn it even with a nearly optimal setup (we had Pala/Warrior Tank, Pala/Druid Heal, 2 Moonkins, 1 Demo Warlock, 1 Arcane Mage, Hunter and Rogue), I would never even try it if I had any choice.\n\nPhase 1: If your DPS is decent (and it has to be, otherwise you won't manage P3) slow down on dpsing so that you can detonate a trap at  71/72 percent. This way you'll only have one trap in P1,5/P2 which just eases stuff. \n\nPhase 2: We optimized our complete setup for this phase, taking 2 Owlkins with us and only one melee. Our tactic was going together from one side to the other, spawning all of the adds in one point. Our warlock (me) and our arcane mage, however, started on the opposing side. This way, we could actually help bombing (you always have aggro of the add you spawned yourself) while the melee finished one of our adds, leaving one harmless add for the cleanup. This tactic changed P2 from nearly unmanageable to easy.\n\nBefore P2.5 starts, bring the boss to 42%, wait for World in Flames, then dps him down as hard as you can without using crucial CDs (you'll need them in P3). This way, you can start P3 with 37% instead of 39%.\n\nPhase 2.5: Have one designated DD prepare an add for a later kill, we had a person to do this on both sides and they communicated who would prepare an add according to the hammer position and number of adds. This way, you can optimize the dps on the adds. With good spawn points, we occasionally started P3 without Scions.\n\nPhase 3: we had our hunter and healers take care of the meteors as much as possible to free up the dps, but I guess the main key to success is a good Phase 2.5 and the World-in-Flames-Trick at the end of P2.\n\nPhase 4: Rule number one is definitely: Don't panic. The phase is rather easy now that you don't have to deal with 3+ meteors. We had one range DD (an owlkin) on meteor duty, meaning that he would kick it away again and again and announce the moment we kite it into our zone (usually parallely to the first roots). Afterwards, it's basically tank and spank with a twist, just be communicative about dreadflame spawnpoints. Right before roots spawned, our offtank left the camp to taunt the boss away from roots spawning right under him (happens more often than you would think, especially on good tries). We had some tries where the dreadflames seemed rather unmanagable (spawning as far apart of each other as possible everytime), but in most of the cases, if your fire extinguisher knows what he's doing, he'll manage it. Took us roughly 25-30 tries in P4 to actually get a kill, probably less than 10% of what guilds had to invest before the nerf :-)\n\nPro tip:\nWhen we reached P4 rather consistently, we allowed trash talking during P1 and P2 (not during Submission Phases) to overcome the extreme boredom of the first 8 minutes of the fight until you finally reach the \"hot\" phase. This made the whole progression a lot funnier without causing any unneccessary wipes.", "date": "2011-11-21T09:49:52-06:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-11-21T09:53:11-06:00", 3, "Namnalia"]}

As a servant of the Old Gods, he fought against the Titans for domination over the planet. The victorious Titans banished him and his brethren to the Elemental Plane \u2014 there to remain imprisoned until the end of time. It was then and there that the brothers turned on each other. For five millennia a battle was fought at the core of this world. It was during the Elemental Sundering that Ragnaros attacked Thunderaan, Prince of Air. Thunderaan was utterly defeated and the Firelord feasted upon his essence, but was unable to consume him entirely. Ragnaros divided what remained between his servants, Baron Geddon and Garr.\r\n\r\nIn the center of a vast lake of fire in the Elemental Plane stands Sulfuron Keep, the home of Ragnaros. Until comparatively recently, he ruled his underground land with a molten iron fist.\r\n\r\nAround three hundred years ago the ambitious and ruthless Dark Iron clan initiated a war against their dwarven brethren, the Bronzebeard clan and Wildhammer clan, thinking that they were about to unite against the Dark Irons. During this War of the Three Hammers, the Dark Iron dwarf leader named Thaurissan lay siege to the Bronzebeard's capital city of Ironforge, while his wife Modgud attacked the Wildhammer capital of Grim Batol. Mudgod was succesful in her assault upon the Wildhammer dwarves, but Thaurissan proved less succesful. The Bronzebeard dwarves repelled his attack and quickly dispatched aid to the Wildhammer dwarves. In a short time, the Dark Irons' fortunes took a turn for the worse, and they were pushed back to the city of Thaurissan, the Dark Iron dwarven home. Thaurissan, seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would turn the tide of the war back to his favor, called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To Thaurissan's surprise, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.\r\n\r\nNow, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. The volcano, known as Blackrock Mountain, was bordered by what is now known as the Searing Gorge, to the north, and the Burning Steppes, to the south. Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving Dark Iron clan brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. Many Dark Iron dwarves remain within the lower areas of the mountain, especially Blackrock Depths, toiling away at the behest of Ragnaros and the Firelord's lieutenants. They worship Ragnaros, considering him not only a Elemental Lord but also an Old God, although he is only affiliated with the Old Gods. The Bronzebeards and Wildhammers, however, remain free.\r\n\r\nWitnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, the Bronzebeards' King Madoran and Wildhammers' King Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros. Now he lies at the bottom of that volcano on Azeroth, striving to find a way home, as well as to gather his strength once again so he can burn away Azeroth and take it for his own. Meanwhile, in Sulfuron Keep and elsewhere across the Firelands, his elemental princes battle constantly for dominance. He and his dwarven minions took control of the Blackrock mountain's volcanic depths and made war on the orcs in the Upper Blackrock Spire, which served as the seat of power for Nefarian the black dragon. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain.", "date": "2012-01-02T08:21:05-06:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting information, do you have a source?", "creationdate": "2016-01-21T23:31:21-06:00", "id": 926123, "rating": 0, "commentid": 1605711, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 256, "username": "Eido", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

[url=http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8655/raggysolo.jpg]Pic[/url].\n\nLike you saw it took ~70 minutes getting the kill, my weapon broke at ~60% which made the fight a lot harder(less SoW/JoL proccs). So bring another 1-2 weapons for a lot easier and faster kill.\n\nI had 413 FR with FR aura and used SoW/JoL and Sacred up constantly. I was hoping I would be able to jump out of Wrath of Ragnaros's knockback range every ~25sec, but my initial feeling was right, he doesn't use it unless someone is in melee range. This made the fight a lot more trickier.\n\nI placed myself [url=http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8962/placement.jpg]here[/url] so I would always get thrown in the lava and therefor avoid the fall damage. It is very important to stay close to the inner circle's lava, since the room for where you hit the floor in the lava is somewhat limited(and ofcourse lag here = baaaad if anyone remembers the lava jump in BRM :P).\nI recommend saving Divine Shield for when you get both Hand of Ragnaros and Wrath of Ragnaros at the same time, I f.x. died once from getting shot out of melee range from Hand of Ragnaros and then when I was running back into my position I got Wrath of Ragnaros'd and didn't land in lava(since I wasn't yet near the inner circle lava). I used JoL/ShoR/HotR every 9s(waiting for J instead of doing 6s abilities first).\n\nWhen the Sons come, go to 969 rotation but depending on mana you might want to skip consecrate. Your goal is to keep 1-2 adds alive and be at full mana ASAP. Then you heal up to full health and kill the remaining adds and rinse and repeat.\n\nNote: You can also FoL between his swings if you're lacking health in between Son Phases.\n\nIn the end was merely done to prove I could and due to lack of challenges :)", "date": "2009-02-23T21:26:48-06:00", "rating": 31, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 1, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-02-24T02:53:13-06:00", 1, "Artharas"]}

With correct positioning you should land in the lava every time and avoid the damage, but if your position is just a little bit off or you are unlucky you can get falling damage and possibly die. \r\nWhen you get knocked back, look to see if it looks like you will get falling damage and have your finger ready on bubble/LoH. Remember that Ardent Defender wont prevent you from dying to falling damage. \r\nAlso note that you will never actually land on ground, but the edge of the lava pool is shallow enough for you to take falling damage. \r\n\r\nYou should position such that you are facing roughly west and thus will be knocked back to the east.

There are various calculators which still uses the old talents, but as these will soon be outdated (and already somewhat are, even before Cataclysm), I see no point in listing the build I used anymore. \r\n\r\nThese are the buffs and items I used on myself: \r\n - Runescroll of Fortitude (+165 stamina)\r\n - Fish Feast (+80 Attack Power, 46 Spell Power and 40 Stamina)\r\n - Scroll of Strength VIII (+30 strength)\r\n - Elixir of Greater Agility (+25 agility, got a lot of them from a friend that leveled alchemy)\r\n - Seal of Vengeance\r\n - Fire Resistance Aura\r\n - Righteous Fury (-6% damage taken via talents)\r\n - Greater Blessing of Sanctuary\r\n\r\nOther buffs that were nearly permanently active: \r\n - Sacred Shield\r\n - Divine Plea\r\n - Holy Strength (+200 strength, from the Libram proc)\r\n\r\nAs healing was no problem I guess I could have swapped out some of the healing-items with my regular tanking gear. My math is too bad (at least too slow) to figure out whether the extra Spell Power boosted my Sacred Shield better than the strength from my tanking gear via the [i]Touched by the Light[/i]-talent.", "date": "2010-08-05T14:41:45-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-10-16T09:27:28-05:00", 3, "FailTrain"]}

Interestingly, I died several times on trash but never on a boss.  I have 264 gear and used a disc pvp spec (for the extra dps from spell reflection).  Archangel is a must for mana regeneration.\r\n\r\nA few notes in no particular order.\r\n\r\n-- Ragnaros's adds are far more challenging than he is, and because of Rag's 1.1 million hit points you'll need to go through several waves of adds.  The adds' combined dps is easily enough to take out a disc priest if you're not careful.  I used power infusion + holy nova spam for a while, but when I dropped to 50% health, I'd fear then focus my dps on the remaining adds near me.  They only have 15k health each and have usually dropped about half from the holy nova spam, so they die fairly quickly.  Hint: fight on the NE side of Ragnaros so you get tossed back into lava, not onto land.\r\n\r\n-- The big fire elemental trash (firelords?  I don't recall their name) are quite a pain.  The have a 15 second silences which is an absolute killer. Not to mention their adds begin splitting.  The adds have a large pile of health each, so it takes a while to get them down (which leaves others to split in the meantime).  I generally focused all my dps on the fire lord and got out my shadowfiend for extra dps as soon as possible, then focused on the adds.  Mostly though you can avoid these guys.\r\n\r\n-- I thought Garr would be more difficult than he was.  I pulled by DOT'ing up a few adds but mostly did my damage through holy nova spam.  Power Word: Shield worked surprisingly well in spite of Garr's dispel magic, as they'd beat through it fairly quickly anyway.\r\n\r\n-- Geddon was a joke.  I fought him in the tunnel to avoid being tossed very high in the air.\r\n\r\n-- Golemagg wasn't too tough, although he did hit rather hard once he was enraged.  I pulled out my shadowfiend after his enrage then cast fade so I could focus my attacks without needing as much healing.  They killed the shadowfiend rather quickly though, so in retrospect I might have been better off serving as a tank while letting the shadowfiend dps Golemagg instead.\r\n\r\n-- Sulfuron's healers hit surprisingly weakly.  I mana burned them outta mana then blew 'em away one by one.  E-Z.\r\n\r\n-- Majordomo's adds were something of a pain, as I had him and eight adds on me at once.  That means their dps drops during the fight though, so don't be afraid to burn your cooldowns earlier on.  (It's an 8-10 minute fight anyway).  I mana burned the healers out of mana (doesn't take long) then pulled out my shadowfiend and focus'ed one down.  From there on it was just a matter of killing the healers one by one, then the other adds.  All in all, not difficult.  Just time-consuming and requiring a bit of concentration.\r\n\r\n-- Shazzrah has a -75% healing curse on you during the fight.  Rather annoying, but you can heal through it anyway (if not very efficiently).  I spent a lot of time ducking out of his flamestorm, but in restrospect I might have been served just sitting through it so I could nuke him down faster.\r\n\r\nOverall, a very fun experience.

Then he starts summoning Sons of Flames these come with eight at a time. The first time I tried Ragnaros he got me there.\n\nSo now we know what can kill us (you can also survive this, don 't get me wrong but my technique might work way better). So now we know our biggest threat.\n\nThis is how it works:\n\n- Before you start the event, set your pet next to Executes. He will be our tank [I use a voidwalker]\n\n- Also in the outer ring, place you portal down. I will explain this later.\n\n- Once started you want this to do:\n\n* Keep your pet alive [mine didn't even needed healing, but it might do]\n* Use teleport when Ragnaros knocks you back\n* Pop [b]ALL CD[/b]'s in this fight, but why? We want to kill him [u]before[/u] he sumberges! So you got about 3 minutes and and a few seconds to kill him. We use the portal to safe us time.

Granted I am in high dps PvE gear, I'm still sure I could easily do it in my V10 PvP gear; kills would just take longer.\r\n\r\nI stealth past all the trash except the occasional dogs that detect me, and gank bosses. They're pretty easy fights and struggle just to beat through improved Recuperate. I use Evasion on the ones with large groups of trash, by the time my 20sec evade runs out they've all died to FoK spam and the boss follows shortly. There isn't much else to say, they're too easy to give strategy. I will say that I learned to point Ragnaros a certain direction so that I land on the ground after punts... that's about it. I could also suggest using Cloak on Baron's bomb debuff to avoid being sky tossed, but it'll only work 1 time and he'll get off 3-4 bombs if you're solo. On Gar and the others with adds just spam FoK with Evasion.\r\n\r\nI also 2man BWL weekly with a guildmember and am starting up SSC/Eye raids too. We all want our fancy T5 and weapons for next patch.

Tried the following all with some success (all in battle stances):\r\n\r\n1.  Nightelf Pure Fury Warrior (with a couple points in Arms and Protection) @ 83, Titan's Grip, and enhanced Bloodthirst / Regeneration bonuses (my normal setup).  No fire resist though.  Figured out how to at least land on the high cliff but can't figure out for the life of me if I can use charge at all while being thrown; it seems to be not at all despite everyone seemingly to say the contrary.  Had no to minor problems with the other bosses but was able to defeat them all except Ragnaros so far.\r\n2.  Respeced into Arms/Fury with that enhanced charge to hit it in the air - that helped a lot!  Seems like I take more damage though with Arms spec.\r\n3.  Arms/Fury boosted from 0 FR up to ~108 Fire Resist\r\n4.  Tried all three of above combinations with 2H+Shield, 2H alone or 1H+Shield...  Seems like the order of best damage I could do was 1H+Shield Fury or Arms, 2H+Shield Fury, and then just plain old 2H with the Arms tree active.  \r\n5.  Tried again with +FR and one of those Darkmoon Cards giving a small heal boost when hitting in melee.  It helped slightly but of course no where near enough.\r\n---(edit)\r\n6.  Purchased a Mending scroll for my weapon.  It helped enough to notice some fight longevity but not enough to counteract his damage.\r\n7.  Likewise tried a Windwalker scroll - that too gave some avoiding damage but not quite enough.\r\n8.  Put an enchantment on every piece of armor I had... helped a little.\r\n9.  Tried a few Golem potions.  Again, nice damage output but not enough.\r\n\r\nGreatest success so far is pretty much the order listed, though the amounts don't vary by too much... I can get him down to the 700's (finally got into 670s on my last try) but nothing close enough to beat him down yet.  Using pot and regeneration but that's pretty much it for healing regardless of setup.  ilevel is about 310.\r\n\r\nJust not sure if I'm geared up enough just yet.  The few warriors posting so far haven't said their levels except for I think, the one 80... I'd imagine I'd be able to kill him at 85 though I hope.  Not saying he's *supposed* to be easy after all but I just wonder if there's something I'm doing \"wrong\".\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFrom the later attempts with focusing on pure defense (1H, Shield, FR), damage (2H, Golem Pot, no FR), or healing (1 or 2H, FR, Mending) I've gotten him consistently down into the 600s.  With mending, I finally hit the upper 400s so getting there ;).  \r\n\r\nAfter every possible combo I can think of, I think I'll simply have to return and try this again at 84 or 85.  Since those two levels continue to offer huge health boosts and recoveries (regeneration), I would think it's doable at 85.", "date": "2011-09-16T04:55:06-05:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-09-17T02:56:51-05:00", 1, "TheRealLink"]}

As a servant of the Old Gods, he fought against the Titans for domination over the planet. The victorious Titans banished him and his brethren to the Elemental Plane \u2014 there to remain imprisoned until the end of time. It was then and there that the brothers turned on each other. For five millennia a battle was fought at the core of this world. It was during the Elemental Sundering that Ragnaros attacked Thunderaan, Prince of Air. Thunderaan was utterly defeated and the Firelord feasted upon his essence, but was unable to consume him entirely. Ragnaros divided what remained between his servants, Baron Geddon and Garr.\r\n\r\nIn the center of a vast lake of fire in the Elemental Plane stands Sulfuron Keep, the home of Ragnaros. Until comparatively recently, he ruled his underground land with a molten iron fist.\r\n\r\nAround three hundred years ago the ambitious and ruthless Dark Iron clan initiated a war against their dwarven brethren, the Bronzebeard clan and Wildhammer clan, thinking that they were about to unite against the Dark Irons. During this War of the Three Hammers, the Dark Iron dwarf leader named Thaurissan lay siege to the Bronzebeard's capital city of Ironforge, while his wife Modgud attacked the Wildhammer capital of Grim Batol. Mudgod was succesful in her assault upon the Wildhammer dwarves, but Thaurissan proved less succesful. The Bronzebeard dwarves repelled his attack and quickly dispatched aid to the Wildhammer dwarves. In a short time, the Dark Irons' fortunes took a turn for the worse, and they were pushed back to the city of Thaurissan, the Dark Iron dwarven home. Thaurissan, seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would turn the tide of the war back to his favor, called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To Thaurissan's surprise, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.\r\n\r\nNow, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. The volcano, known as Blackrock Mountain, was bordered by what is now known as the Searing Gorge, to the north, and the Burning Steppes, to the south. Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving Dark Iron clan brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. Many Dark Iron dwarves remain within the lower areas of the mountain, especially Blackrock Depths, toiling away at the behest of Ragnaros and the Firelord's lieutenants. They worship Ragnaros, considering him not only a Elemental Lord but also an Old God, although he is only affiliated with the Old Gods. The Bronzebeards and Wildhammers, however, remain free.\r\n\r\nWitnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, the Bronzebeards' King Madoran and Wildhammers' King Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros. Now he lies at the bottom of that volcano on Azeroth, striving to find a way home, as well as to gather his strength once again so he can burn away Azeroth and take it for his own. Meanwhile, in Sulfuron Keep and elsewhere across the Firelands, his elemental princes battle constantly for dominance. He and his dwarven minions took control of the Blackrock mountain's volcanic depths and made war on the orcs in the Upper Blackrock Spire, which served as the seat of power for Nefarian the black dragon. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain.", "date": "2012-01-02T08:20:15-06:00", "rating": 25, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Let me start by saying, yes, you can find this pet in Booty Bay and Tol Barad; if you're farming on a level 90 character, I recommend farming in Tol Barad.  Booty Bay has an issue where a lot of the spawn points for the Wharf Rat will be in areas where the battle area is obstructed and you can't actually pull it.  \r\n\r\nAs for Tol Barad, the rat spawns in Rustberg Village, the town to the northeast.  Despite it's name, it can spawn anywhere along the roads of the city (including the road that runs east-west in between Rustberg Village and Largo's Point / the spider area at the edge of the city) or along the docks of the wharf.  There is always one Wharf Rat spawn at a time; once you kill this, a new one will spawn in 30 seconds or less, often instantly.  This gives you a very consistent source of Wharf Rats to pull.  Also, the only secondaries that can spawn are Wharf Rats and Squirrels, and you get 2, so on average you're getting TWO Wharf Rats everytime you pull (the primary spawn plus one secondary spawn on average).  This leads to a very large number of chances for a rare in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe downside to farming in Rustberg is the combination of mobs that will actually aggro onto you with the fact you can't just fly around.  My suggestion is that you should run around in a loop, including the east-west running road at the southern edge of the town and the docks (basically, run around the edges of the town).  Most spawns occur on either this southern road or the docks, and this path will let you see spawns in the center of the town anyway.  Don't stop to kill enemy mobs unless you get dismounted.  Once you see a spawn, stop far enough away from it that you won't accidentally kill it, aoe down whatever has aggrod onto you (at 90 this shouldn't take more than a few seconds), then pull the Wharf Rat.

Place yourself so that one of the fields w/ Orc Raiders patrolling is to your right, and the Mechanical farmhands field is to your left, with your back in line w/ the road dividing these 2 fields. You should see a building straight ahead of you with Faithful Watchdogs in the area around the building. Start heading towards that building straight on. You might not have noticed from the intersection based on how your camera was panned, but as you get closer to the building you should see an entrance to a cave, and if you placed yourself appropriately will be set up to head into it. Continue straight into the smaller cave entrance you see once are in the bigger cave entrance.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 3, "id": 6631, "nreplies": 1, "sticky": 0, "user": "7049", "body": "On the west end of the room there is an Orb, used to mind control Razorgore through stage 1 of the fight; the ideal situation consists of 2 controllers (paladins -bubble and control- for an alliance raid or anything else suitable, but keep in mind that the controllers must survive during this phase, as the use of Razorogore's abilities is crucial for the success of this stage) taking turns in mind controlling Razorgore.\n\nThe mind controlling process can begin even before the kill of Grethok and should be targeted on destroying the eggs (95% of the time), the only case in which you won't use this ability is when it is on cooldown. Then you might want to use the \"sleep dragonkin\" ability, as the fireball volley usually draws too much aggro on Razorgore, which, as you might guess, must stay alive during phase 1.\n\nThe adds that i've been mentioning so far are of 3 types: melee (legionnaires), dragonkin and mages. As you prolly expect, the melee ones (first 2 types) are hard hitting, heavy armoured etc. kind of mobs, while\nthe mages are more fragile but more dangerous too due to their AOE attacks. The easier way is to keep the adds population mainly consisting of melee and the dps group in your raid should nuke the mages asap; of\ncourse, it's not a piece of cake to tank the melee damagers, but it's preferable to being batch killed by the mages. Healers, heal, tankers, tank and dps-ers, do the dps! It's that simple, isn't it? Now, balance is\neverything. There's no need to keep the orcs alive with any cost, of course you must decimate them to keep a controllable population, but only if the mages are being taken care of, as killing them is the highest\npriority for you. Tip: mind control the orcs and use them to kill the dragonkins, as they have 400% damage bonus against them. If the dragonkin number is too big, use the druids to sleep a part of them, anytime\nrequired (and it is required most of the stage, in fact). Any other classes that can croud control should do so (sleep, sheep, fear, scream), in an organized fashion and if possible by taking turns, in order to keep a\neven threat. During stage 1 also try to kite as much as possible, a horde raid could use the shamans' earth binding totems, everybody can use the hunters' traps etc.\n\nBy the end, the chaos is spreading and the numbers of the adds raises insanely, but do not panic, as all of them will go away when the last egg is destroyed. In order to make it to this final moment of stage\n1,when there's only 3-4 eggs left, use all your CC abilities and chain fear everything, don't focus on killing, but escaping them.\n\nPhase 2: time to kill Razorgore itself.\n\nRazorgore has, beside his melee attack, a hurting fireball volley and a conflagrate attack that gets you out of your control, burning you and the people around you. This is the reason for dps-ing him mainly ranged\nand using more than one tank. The MT is facing Razorgore, the backup tanks are behind him. When the unfortunate conflag event happens, the MT also loses aggro, so a backup tank should take his palce immediately, while the burning ex-MT steps back in order to protect the others of catching fire.\nAs you might have noticed, there's a lot of fire involved, so it's not a bad idea to bring along some fire resistance equipment, but bear in mind that you'll not leave the \"in combat\" state between the 2 stages of\nthe fight, so no gear switching is possible.\n\nTry to take advantage of the large size of the room. In the unfortunate case a healer should die, have a druid rez him in-combat, but as far away as possible from the action. The ressurected healer will be out of\ncombat and will be able to bring back some of the other fallen comrades.\nHowever, it's best not to come to this, as the unpredicted can interfere and mess the things up.\n\n(Strategy from Ana's Lair)", "date": "2006-12-05T18:12:01-06:00", "rating": 23, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 1, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Here's the strat our guild uses:  Razorgore is the first boss you meet in BWL.

Usually \r\nteam A is groups 1 and 2 who go west \r\nteam B is groups 3 and 4 who go north \r\nteam C is groups 5 and 6 who go east \r\nteam D is groups 7 and 8 who go south \r\n\r\nEach team gets \r\n1 Hunter \r\n1-2 Warriors \r\n2 Priests/Druids \r\n1 Paladin \r\n1 Warlock \r\n1-2 Rogues \r\n1-2 Mages \r\n\r\nA spokesperson for each team on TS announces spawns in the corners. \r\n\r\nPHASE I (EGGS) \r\n\r\nDPS\r\nA mage or rogue in each team is appointed Main Assist, Mages, Hunters and Rogues in the team will help kill his target. His target are all Orc Mages in the corner. They have to die ASAP until eventually only Legionaires and Dragonkin remain) \r\n\r\nWarriors \r\nThe warrior(s) in each corner sunder (build aggro on) each dragonkin and legionaire in their corner and kite it between the two platforms (running up the stairs and jumping down in the middle front exploits the no-jump pathing of the mos and gets distance between warrior and his heat. Piercing Howl helps too. Eventually all 55 mobs will be following the warriors and if all goes fine, they wont even take damage. \r\n\r\nHealers \r\nThe healers in each team keep their warriors always shielded and HoT'ed. Optimal position for them to be is the front corner of the platform on their side. From there they always have a LoS to all team members and especially the warriors roaming their corner currently (usually its 2 tanks you have to keep track of, yours and the one of the team accross the room who follows the same path as your warrior). Also if they get hit, they can easily get some distance by jumping down the edge and running. Priest should use the CTRA aggro-gain announcer to be able to cast fade before the mob hits them. \r\n\r\nPaladins\r\nPaladins are the orb controllers. They place themselves below the orb right from the start and destroy eggs as fast as possible. They should not take damage during the egg phase at all. Once all eggs are down, the primary orb user will have a lot of aggro from Razorgore and he will come straight after him. We use that to position razor immediately in a good spot and to bring him to the MT tag-team. \r\n\r\nPHASE II \r\n\r\nThe MT tag team builds aggro on razorgore. Every now and them Razor casts a frontal AoE conflag that temporarily wipes all aggro on the current tank, swithing it to the offtank. Position of the 2 tanks is 90", "date": "2006-12-09T13:36:03-06:00", "rating": 5, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Kiting &Corner Control\r\n3. Chaos & Razorgore\r\n[Raid Group & Positioning]:\r\n- Each Corner is assigned 2 well-balanced Groups:\r\n- Corner A, Groups 1 & 2\r\n- Corner B, Groups 3 & 4\r\n- Corner C, Groups 5 & 6\r\n- Corner D, Groups 7 & 8\r\n- Odd Groups, High-Aggro Kiters &amp; DPS (Outer Square)\r\n- Even Groups, Low-Aggro Squishies (Inner Square)\r\n\r\n1. [The Pull]:\r\n- Entire Raid carefully stacks and buffs up at the Center of the Room.\r\n- Raid pulls the Controller and Guards to the Center.\r\n- OrbController goes in and takes control of Razorgore.\r\n- Raid Focus Fires on Controller, then the 2x Guards.\r\n- Immediately after 2nd Guard drops, Raid breaks to their assigned corners.\r\n\r\n2. [Kiting &amp; Corner Control]:\r\n- While Razorgore is destroying the eggs, numerous spawns will appear:<BR>- Blackwing Mages: Kill On Sight.\r\n- Blackwing Legionnaires: Kited by 2x Main Tanks.\r\n- Blackwing Dragonkin: CC'ed by Hunters, Warlocks, and Druids.\r\n- Spawns will continue at 1-2 per corner every 15 secs.\r\n[Class Responsibilities]:\r\n\r\nBlackwing Legionnaire Kiting:\r\n- 2x MT Warriors, Spam Demoralizing Shout. Figure 8's.\r\n\r\nBlackwing Mage DPS:\r\n- Mages, NO AOE. Focus Fire. Crowd Control.\r\n- Rogues, Assigned as MTs of Each Corner.\r\n- Warriors (spares), Focus Fire.\r\n\r\nBlackwing Dragonkin CC:\r\n- Hunters, Hunter's Mark &amp; Kite one Dragonkin using Scatter Shot.\r\n-Warlocks, single target fear an unmarked (Hunter's Mark) Dragonkin.\r\n- Druids, hibernate loose (unmarked &amp; unfeared)  Dragonkin.\r\n\r\nRaid Support:\r\n- Priests, shield &amp; renew players. Fade defensively.\r\n- Shaman, drop Totems. Heal. Kite loose Blackwing Legionnaires.\r\n                              \r\n3. [Chaos &amp; Razorgore]:\r\n\r\n- When 4-5 Eggs remain, Orb Controller will use \"Fireball Volley.\"\r\n- Every mob within the instance (40) will immediately aggro Razorgore.\r\n- Fear Rotation to prevent damage on Razorgore. Focus  Heals on Razorgore.\r\n- Stun, Frost Nova, Scatter, Frost Trap -- KEEP THEM OFF RAZORGORE!\r\n- Spawns will disappear and Razorgore will heal himself to full.\r\n- OrbController moves towards Corner A and Vanishes.\r\n[Razorgore Abilities]:\r\n1. Melee Attack & Cleave.\r\n2. Warstomp AOE, Knocks of all melee  Aggro.\r\n3. Conflagration frontal cone AOE, unremovable DoT with confusion.\r\n4. Fireball Volley (every 20 secs), LoS 1k dmg fireball. Max  range / hide!\r\n[Fighting Razorgore]:\r\n- MT & OT must be engaged at all times, facing Razorgore to Corner A.\r\n-  MT = Front, OT = Back.\r\n- When MT is conflag'ed, OT takes and faces Razorgore back towards corner.\r\n- Similar to Onyxia Phase 1, allow Tanks to build sufficient aggro before DPS.\r\n- While Tanks build aggro, Soulstone & Combat  Rez players.\r\n- CONTROLLED RANGED DPS, to kill  Razorgore. Very similar to Onyxia\r\n\r\n>>Just what my guild used", "date": "2006-12-10T21:56:36-06:00", "rating": 4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

This fight requires a minimum of two people to defeat: one to kite the adds, one to control Razorgore.\n\nI was our designated kiter. We tried several times with my prot pally (because, hey, pallies are unkillable right?), and had a ton of problems since I could not pick up all the adds. With the change to consecrate, you can no longer drop it continuously to help you maintain aggro. This resulted in a lot of hits on my partner, who would then get the debuff and be unable to MC Razorgore. Many wipes happened. \n\nOn my druid tank, this became no problem at all due to healing aggro. Imp. LOTP is crucial here - I faced the adds tanking backwards when able, using every GCD to trigger the heals from LOTP. For my kiting path, I used the good old figure-8, waiting til the adds all gathered on the platform and then jumped off. This gave me time to shift out and pop a rejuv and regrowth on myself, get back to bear form, and kite again.\n\nHealing aggro was always a problem for druids in this encounter - I remember having to downrank as a resto druid in vanilla WoW and STILL getting threat on random mobs. Well, now it's working to keep all the adds trailing after me. It's amazing how fast they would all zone in on me, almost completely ignoring my partner. He took a few hits, but I could easily run up, swipe, and get the adds off of him.\n\nYou could probably do something to maintain healing aggro with a pally, but honestly it was so much easier with my druid. \n\nAfter Razorgore, I swapped back to my prot pally and we easily downed the rest of BWL.\n\nETA: looks like they may have fixed the pet problem with the Orb of Domination.

I just did it tonight with a death knight.\r\n\r\nThe second class works on the mind controlling.  Using the mind control orb will allow you to control him for up to 90 seconds.  If you get hit once by mobs, the channel lasts 67.5 seconds.  If you get hit twice, it lasts 45 seconds.  Since the debuff lasts 60 seconds, you can have a 100% uptime with the mind control as long as you only get hit once or not at all.\r\n\r\nThe resto druid simply stacks Lifebloom on himself and runs back and forth around the room.  With Lifebloom rolling, all adds will instantly aggro you from the healing and ignore Razorgore and your partner (ensuring 100% MC uptime).  Simply run up the stairs on one side of the room, wait for the melee dragons to almost reach you, jump off, run to the other side of the room, run up the stairs, wait, jump, repeat.  The mobs run slightly faster than you, so jumping off the platform gives you some breathing time where you're not being attacked while they do a bit of backtracking down the sides of the platforms.  The caster mobs will just fireball you from wherever in the room they are.  They're lousy shots, though.\r\nI would imagine Shamans can also do this easily with Riptide and Ancentral Swiftness/Earthbind (keeping completely ahead of all melee damage) and [i]maybe[/i] Priests with PW:S and Renew.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would seem the add bug as been fixed.  After breaking all the adds, all mobs fled the room, leaving only Razorgore to be DPS'd down.  Piece of cake.  I popped Tree of Life, proc'd Nature's Grace, and enjoyed my 1 sec cast Wrath spam.  ;)\r\n\r\nKeep in mind I had the minor run speed increase at the time.  I'm not sure if it's necessary though.  I never really dropped below 95% mana with a rolling Lifebloom stack and an occasional Rejuv.  I was only ever hit hard when the clump of melee adds caught up to me and all 50 of them smacked me all at once, which dropped me to about 75% health.  I Swiftmended just to be safe.\r\n\r\nI felt accomplished with the strategy, considering we had just wiped on 5 attempts to DPS the adds and desperately try to stay alive and not have Razorgore die prematurely.  =P\r\n\r\nWe were both in iLvl 329 gear.", "date": "2011-02-07T01:55:46-06:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Naturally, this is a problem when your tank can't taunt him back over and when using the orb again doesn't do anything at all to solve the issue of an instant wipe on wheels careening towards you at high speeds.\n\nRazorgore appears to bug and evade when the controller doesn't have Mind Exhaustion, the debuff that keeps them from using the orb again until it runs out, when he breaks free. Again, this hasn't been confirmed anywhere, and I haven't seen anyone else mention it, but I am almost certain that the lack of the debuff is what causes him to evade. Or at least maintaining the debuff is a workaround to whatever the real issue is. If he does go out of combat like others say he sometimes does (which causes him to evade) then somehow keeping the Mind Exhaustion debuff keeps him in combat when you lose control over him.\n\nSo, cut off possession of Razorgore a few seconds before the debuff runs out. Using /dance was a simple way to lose control (plus, bear dancing makes everything better). Our tank was able to easily pick him up after I danced and kept the debuff, and we didn't have the evading problem for the whole fight. The entire thing is a cakewalk without the evade bug.\n\nAs a side note, you have control over him for 90 seconds by default; if he doesn't get hit by anything, you definitely have to cut off control early, since the Mind Exhaustion debuff only lasts 60 seconds.\n\nEDIT: Just this past Saturday (nearly a month after I initially wrote this comment) I ran Blackwing Lair with a new group and we could still /dance our way through Razorgore without any problems at all. We didn't try anything else (such as changing the placement of the orb controller, putting a dot on Razorgore, etc) and we were fine.\n\n\n\n[i]Edited for great justice and wording problems.[/i]", "date": "2011-02-19T18:49:22-06:00", "rating": 21, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Seconded.

(ilvls ~353)\n[b]\nRazorgore the Untamed:[/b]\n\nThe key here is to not waste time with Razorgores \"destroy eggs\" ability, it has a seven second cooldown so use it as soon as it comes off cooldown. Have the warrior pick up the adds from the orb platform and the priest immediately MC Razorgore and destroy the first egg, then kill the adds and warrior moves to the middle of the room. So long as the warrior is around the middle area (the big square between the two platforms) the adds will ignore the player on the orb and attack the warrior in the middle.\nClear out the eggs on Razors platform first, you want to keep him in the middle of the room with the warrior so the adds can be picked up more easily.\nThis is multitask heavy: Kill egg, move razor to next egg while \"destroy egg\" is on cooldown, tab to warrior, pickup/kill adds, tab back to razor to kill next egg, rinse and repeat.\n\nTip: [i]Make sure you have plenty of time remaining on the MC before killing the adds on the orb platform, if it breaks while he is there he may destroy the orb and wipe the encounter.[/i]\n\n[b]\nVaelastrasz the Corrupt[/b]\n\nNothing special here, go dps and nuke the hell out of him - with two toons it should not be all that difficult. You simply have to kill him before Burning Adrenaline kills you.\n\n[b]Broodlord Lashlayer[/b]\n\nTank n spank, keep your back to the door so he doesn't knock you into the adds.\n[b]\nFiremaw[/b]\n\nTank n spank, but kill him quickly.\n[b]\nEbonrok[/b]\n\n[s]This guy is tricky. Warrior as tank, priest as dps. Ebonrok will periodically put a debuff on the current target that heals him for 25,000 every time he hits that target - needless to say unless your dps is godly you will have to target swap each time this happens. Here's how to do it.\nHave your tank stand with his back to the wall up where Ebonrok patrols, have the priest stand about 30 yards away from the tank - the priest will open up as dps until Ebonrok puts the debuff on the priest, the warrior then taunts but [u][b]DOES NOT ATTACK[/b][/u] Ebonrok - this is important. Ebonrok will go to the warrior and and begin attacking him - all you want to do is pull Ebonrok off the priest long enough for the debuff to drop off. If the priest resumes attacking as soon as Ebonrok is over at the warrior he should surpass the warriors threat and Ebonrok will return to the priest right about the time the debuff is put on the warrior.\nIn this way Ebonrok will not hit the target with the debuff to heal himself, or no more than a couple of swings.[/s]\n\nKeep Power Word:Shield up on tank at all times, Ebonrok won't heal as no damage is done. If you don't have a priest, use the above method.\n\n[b]Flamegor[/b]\n\nTank n spank.\n\n[b]Chromaggus[/b]\n\nAnother somewhat tricky fight, firstly make sure both toons have ample amounts of Hourglass Sand to remove Brood Affliction: Bronze - if you have been killing the trash from Broodlord Lashlayer up to this point you will have plenty of it.\nThe key here is never let all five debuffs be up at once, as this will mind control your character - which will then kill your other character, and reset Chromaggus.\nKeeping the priest out of LOS of Chromaggus does not appear to work anymore, they will still receive the debuffs. As soon as a debuff comes up that can be removed, remove it - except Brood Affliction: Red, multiple stacks of this makes it pretty much impossible to keep off and keep dps up on your warrior so concentrate on keeping Brood Afflictions: Blue, and Bronze off your toons and keep dpsing - red will eventually start to hurt a lot so kill Chromaggus as soon as possible but ALWAYS make sure to keep those debuffs off.\n\n[b]Nefarian[/b]\n\nTank n spank, use the alcove* to channel all the adds into one place for easy pickup.\nMake sure your priest is close to your warrior so he doesn't get smashed by the adds later in the fight, they can still kill clothies fairly quickly - even at 85.\n\n*The alcove. When facing the throne turn 90 degrees to the right and you'll see a sort of short tunnel with rubble in it.\n\n\nHappy hunting!\nAth.", "date": "2011-06-16T04:48:04-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This was the best tactic to easily kill Razorgore that I've tried.

The \"platform\" is the podium-like structure with the mind control orb. The \"little ledge below\" is exactly that, a slightly raised lip at the front of the mind control orb platform.\n-\nI'll try to explain a little better:\n\nI'm using Seal of Righteousness and Righteous Fury.\n\n[b][u]The Pull [/u][/b]- Run in and head up the near ramp towards the MC orb, clear the mobs from the platform and use the orb, Razorgore will probably be pretty close at this point.\n\n[b][u]MC phase[/u][/b] - I usually jump off the front of the MC orb platform, onto the kerb in front. I may choose to use Holy Radiance or Consecration just prior to clicking the orb if necessary (it rarely is). Run around bursting eggs, generally I'll destroy the nearest one to me and then head to the far end of the room until the MC timer is nearly up. At this point I'll start heading back towards the MC orb, continuing to pop eggs on the way.\n\n[u][b]Post-MC phase[/b][/u] - I seem to have trouble manually breaking MC, whether it's a bug, or my UI I don't know. Anyway, once it's broken, I'll launch into a flurry of aoe in order to thin out the adds and \"hopefully\" evade Razorgore...\n\nThe best I can explain it is as follows.\n\nRun up one of the ramps to the MC orb and he'll follow, jump off the front and step onto the ledge below while spamming Divine Storm, Holy Wrath and whatever else you feel like using. If you time it right he'll evade, so will some adds most likely. The basic rules of evading mobs apply here, if you try to hit him when he can't hit you he'll evade. Divine storm from underneath him, hitting a couple of adds that have his attention seems to work. He will figure out how to reach you and run down the ramp a lot of the time, just keep trying.\n\nIt's also possible to do by being on top of the MC platform while he is on the floor below. Using Judgement to gain some distance from him while he's stopped to cast, he will sometimes get stuck just at the corner of the platform, on the ground, near the ramps at either side. When trying to evade him you have to make sure your attacks hit him so he \"notices\" he can't hit you in return and resets. I haven't got either evade technique down to a science yet, but on my latest kill, he didn't come close to dying so I'm getting better at it.\n\nOnce his health has reset, adds are under control and your MC debuff is gone, repeat the process until all the eggs are done.\n\nBubbling the conflag isn't required to complete it, it's just a bit of insurance in case I have trouble resetting his health, or adds are starting to get too much. I'm fairly sure other classes will be capable of using this tactic, providing they can heal themselves well enough.\n\nI've managed to clear the entire instance solo for three weeks running now, since discovering this tactic.\n\nGood Luck.", "date": "2011-07-08T17:32:12-05:00", "rating": 5, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I don't seem to be able to trigger the evade anymore.

Run Razorgore around, clicking on your \"Destroy Egg\" ability while standing atop (or just behind) the eggs on the ground.\n3. Keep this up until the adds start spawning.

AoE your little heart out atop the platform for a few moments, killing as many as you can before Razorgore gets to you.\n5. Once Razorgore gets to you, you can try single targeting a few more adds around him down if you need to, just try not to hit Razorgore.

I ran in and killed the mobs at the orb.\r\n2. I mc'ed Razorgore and started killing eggs. I ran him to the farthest eggs, because he was further from me when I dropped the mc and when I finished with eggs he was nearby in melee range.\r\n3. I ignored all the adds beating on Razorgore and kept killing eggs.\r\n4. I let Razorgore get to about 20% health when I ran him close to me and targeted him. I used my lay on hands on him to heal him to full, consecrated, and re-mc'ed him. If I was getting overwhelmed with adds, I would use consecrate and hammer of righteous and holy wrath. That would kill the adds around me.\r\n5. I kept killing eggs and if Razorgore got low on health again, I would run him away from me and drop the mc and build up combo points on the trash, re-mc Razorgore and use Word of Glory on him. This was enough to keep him alive long enough to kill the remaining eggs.\r\n6. Once the eggs were all dead, the mc broke and I went to town on him with my prot dps. He wasn't alive for long.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that you can use healing abilities on Razorgore if you have him selected. It will break the MC but it'll heal him before it breaks. This is key because if you don't have any healing abilities, the adds will either overwhelm you or him. Bandages would also work but you'd only get one tick of it before the mc breaks and that's not enough to keep him alive for long. \r\n\r\nAlso remember to drop the MC every now and than to get the adds to agro onto you instead of him. The less you have to heal him, the faster you can kill the eggs. The cooldown on the egg breaker is now 1.5 seconds, down from 7 seconds it used to be. \r\n\r\nYou may be able to kill all the eggs without healing him if you drop the mc often enough to get most of the adds on you.

Plenty of people have tried to kill him straight away which results in the normal wipe regardless of immunities used (eg Paladin Shield or Mage Ice-block). Also, if the adds kill him it's the same result. The adds spawn still do the same damage, which doesn't do much to a 90 individually but the more you have spawn on you the worse it gets. They'll still do the same damage as before to Razorgore so getting them off him is a priority, especially if he starts taking lots of noticeable damage.\n\n[b]IMPORTANT[/b] - The adds spawn constantly, there is no max number spawned at any time, they're endless and spawn in the 4 corners of the room. Don't let yourself or Razorgore get overwhelmed. These adds run away \\ despawn once Razorgore destroys the last egg. \n\nHOWEVER, and this is a BIG HOWEVER, there are 2 very big changes to this encounter:-\n\n1) No more debuff from using the Orb. This means you can release him at [u]any time[/u] and retake control when ready. Just remember 1 key thing - if Razorgore reaches the orb he destroys it and kills you instantly.\n\n2) Razorgore's Destroy Egg has [u]no cooldown[/u].

Here are the two keys: learning how to break MC and learning how to re-MC him even though you have mobs attacking you.  There is no button you can click on to break MC.  You'll notice however, that you have an action bar for Razorgore when he is MC'd.  And you also have your own action bar.  You can click on him or yourself (your icons rather) and cast a spell and this is what breaks the MC.  Don't have pets out or you can't re-MC.  You might want to put him on focus to make it easier to click on him.  Towards the middle-bottom of your screen you will see the \"channel\" bar, which is really slow, but you MUST pay attention to it because this dictates your moves.\n\nEach one of you will have to develop your own method to the madness but the basic strat is this:\n\n(1) There are 30 eggs in total I think.  You need to kill up to 8 eggs on the first MC, starting with all of those on and near your platform first and moving him towards the far platform.  Put every dragon attacking Razorgore to sleep, without exception, because they do the most damage.\n(2) When the first MC wears off, you are now on your platform being attacked by a huge mob.  Pop your CD's and nuke them quick.  Only one or two of your attacks will take HUGE gobs of his health down, so when Razorgore gets close, even if you are still being attacked, clicky on the orb again. You might experience some pushback but you can do eet.  You MUST do eet or you will fail, so keep trying.  Consider popping a heal-potion first, or save it for later when your health starts to get really low.\n(3) Once you have him re-MC'd, go back to clearing out all the eggs, but this time you are watching your health and his health.  You can heal him up, which will break the MC, but he must be within range.  I had to bring him back once and loh, nuke a few adds, then re-MC, and burn more eggs.\n\nOnce I figured out the basic rules of how to break MC and re-MC even though I was being interrupted periodically, the fight became fairly easy, although tense.  With the final egg gone, the adds cleared out by themselves and it was me on him.  He likes to cc you, so make sure your health is up before concentrating on him or you might let it slip through your fingers at the very end.  \n\nGood luck and have fun!", "date": "2013-02-28T21:11:43-06:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2013-02-28T21:13:59-06:00", 2, "TheZoog"]}

First thing I do is plant 3 mushrooms on the main floor below the podium with the orb in a decent spread so as to do max damage/kills. \r\n\r\n2.

I read a comment earlier on this same topic that said something about the mechanic of the fight coming before any DPS, damage etc. This is true.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you want to make sure you can heal yourself in between controlling the orb. Even though you are (most likely) level 90, you will be taking quite a bit of damage. Nothing to worry too much about, but it is still something to watch.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this encounter would be super easy if Razorgore didn't get attacked by other minions. Razorgore doesn't keep your health so the enemies take Razorgore down pretty fast. My tactic here is (as a Paladin) take down half the eggs on the Orb's side so that if any enemy attacks Razorgore they'll go after me instead. Then, I'll take down some of the eggs on the other side of room where mobs will begin to attack me. I have to be careful here. If I can't take down all the eggs in one run, I stop when Razorgore is at half health, when I throw down a few AoE to kill the enemies near me. Then I carefully pick off and tag the enemies that are around Razorgore, killing them all. Of course, Razorgore will run after you and mass stun you if he gets close. Basically I Divine Shield and do one of the following:\r\n\r\n 1) If you can't use the Orb while Immune (I can't remember if this is the way or not), I kite Razorgore to the other side and then run like hell with as much speed buffs as I can back to the orb, but never spam click it.\r\n\r\n 2) If it's not like that, well just use the orb and destroy the remaining eggs. Easily done.\r\n\r\nThe actual fight afterwards is super easy, shouldn't be a problem for level 85s to 90s, and even 80's will be finding him soloable after the egg mechanic.\r\n\r\nI hope this helped all classes in trying to solo this fight.

Much easier at 100, still doable at 90 (hence the edit of below instead of a full delete).\n[hr]Okay, trying this during 7.1.5 and was dying and dying and dying (and dying). Decided to try some new theories here since all previous methods of \"dropping aggro\" weren't working for me (clicking the orb just gave me a 10s debuff and when I got Razorgore back, adds stayed on him). Hoplowe's more recent comment/strat [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=12435/razorgore-the-untamed#comments:id=2449287]here[/url] (Nov 28th) is what finally worked for me. The basic gist is that it uses the first 2-3 full channels of mind control to collect the adds that will spawn so that on subsequent mind controls you (character) should keep all the aggro off you (Razorgore). This worked basically well for me except I had one add stay on me that almost killed me as I went through the room.\n[hr]\n[small][u]Key Points:[/u]\n[ol]\n[li]You must dismiss any pets before being able to use the control orb.[/li]\n[li]Adds will spawn and can aggro to you on the orb, or to Razorgore. There is a maximum number of adds that will enter the room. They will respawn to this max if you kill them.[/li]\n[li]Razorgore is not a typical \"vehicle\" in the sense used in later expansions. To dismiss, you must right-click > dismiss from his portrait (under your portrait).[/li]\n[li]It is possible (and, in my opinion, easier) to kill Razorgore [i]without killing any adds[/i].[/li]\n[li]Boss can drop a pet: [item=93036] which grants [npc=68661] as criteria for [achievement=7934][/li]\n[li]Razorgore will randomly attack any egg within 6-8 yards. [b]TIP: That means you can stand in one spot between several eggs and be \"in range\" of more than one egg at a time.[/b][/li]\n[li]When Razorgore is closer to you on the orb, adds are more likely to aggro to you (on orb) instead of him, and will sometimes swap aggro from him to you (on orb).[/li]\n[li]Classes with insta-cast HOTs are able to use them on Razorgore while he is mind-controlled. The heal will break your MC, which you can regain by selecting the control orb again. This has the chance to have Razorgore pull a lot of aggro off of you, so it might not be useful for all HOT classes.[/li]\n[li][b]If Razorgore dies during phase 1, you die, too.[/b][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[u]Strategy:[/u]\n[ol]\n[li]Dismiss any pets/minions.[/li]\n[li]Run in and kill the 3 guys on the orb. The main controller can detect stealth.[/li]\n[li]Click the orb to gain control of Razorgore.[/li]\n[li]Start killing eggs (\"4\" on your action bar) closest to wherever the boss is when you gain control of him. Ignore adds.[/li]\n[li]Move between clusters of eggs in a pattern that takes you towards [the control orb] [s][i]the far end of the room (opposite the control orb) back through the room. As you circle back towards the control orb, some of the adds attacking the boss will swap to attack you on the orb[/i][/s].[/li]\n[li][s][i]At some point in the fight, your mind control spell will reach the end of its channel and you'll re-enter your body. Kill whatever you want, but the key is to regain mind control on Razorgore asap. Player aoe can kill Razorgore if you spam it and he's too close, so be weary. If you have a [item=86565], this would be a great time to use it. You'll pull the adds off the boss, sparing his health.

Here is truly THE only thing that has ever worked for me, and has worked EVERY time flawlessly as of April 8, 2015. I will be very detailed just so that there is no question, but once you do this, you'll see how easy it is:\n\n[ol]\n\n[li]Kill the mobs around the orb.[/li]\n\n[li]Jump down to the floor below and click the orb from max range. Face outwards.[/li]\n\n[li]Walk Razorgore over to you, and first destroy the egg in front of your toon, then the two eggs up on the platform with the orb.[/li]\n\n[li]Then, move Razorgore to the back of the platform, turn around and back him into the wall, tail first as far as you can go, so that he is facing outwards towards the orb. You will not be able to see your toon, but if you cleared the 2 eggs on the platform, you will be able to see the orb, and also beyond it, you can see the mobs spawning from the other side of the room, running towards the platform.[/li]\n\n[li]Wait a while... until all ~40 mobs spawn. If you did this all correctly so far, you will observe how all mobs run up to the platform and up to the orb, but they then turn around, walk down to the floor, and attack your toon instead. This is because your toon is closest aggro.[/li]\n\n[li]This is critical to success: Before the timer expires, say, with about 5 sec left, [u]reclick the orb while it is still channeling[/u], but also [u]only click it only once[/u] every time you are recasting the mind control. Reclicking the orb as it is still channeling instantly starts the timer over, and Razorgore will not move at all since he is only released for just a microsecond. If you don't do this, Razorgore being free even 1 second can allow him to move close enough to draw aggro from the mobs running up to the orb before they can aggro on you. Clicking the orb just once to re-channel is also important because it has a cooldown of about 8 seconds. So if you spam click it out of paranoia, you'll incur the cooldown, Razorgore will walk down the platform and you lose.[/li]\n\n[li]After a while, you'll see that no more mobs are spawning and they are all attacking you. Any level 100 will easily auto-regen the damage they do. You are now free to take Razorgore around the room and destroy all the eggs. First, destroy the eggs at the other side of the room, and then work your way to the ones closest to your toon last, to avoid any aggro. As with #6, always reclick the orb [u]before[/u] the timer expires so that you retain constant control. Remember, it doesn't matter how far Razorgore is from the orb. Your toon is always right by it, so you can reclick the orb from anywhere in the room you are playing with Razorgore.[/li]\n\n[li]After all eggs are destroyed, the mobs will start to run away. Do NOT attack Razorgore yet. Wait until the mobs are gone, and then mouseover the orb. If the orb is NOT clickable anymore, then the egg event has completed and you can now 1-shot Razorgore with your most furious graphics-card shattering attack.[/li]\n\n\nEDIT: This strat works due to two key aspects of this encounter:\na) There are a limited number of mobs that can be active at one time - about 40\nb) If they are not attacked, the mobs aggro the nearest creature and stay there until something else comes closer", "date": "2015-04-08T22:41:48-05:00", "rating": 259, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wish I could up vote this more than once.

Kill the 3 guys at the orb and then use the orb to mind control (MC) Razoregore\n\n2. Bring Razorgore onto your platform and get him to kill the two eggs there. \n\n3. Park Razorgore at the back of the curved wall on your platform - at the very back so his head is buried in the wall. \n\n4. Mobs will start spawning, but they will run to you, not Razorgore\n\n5. Let the mobs pile up on you - at 100 they will all miss you anyway - and when MC runs out re-MC immediately but do not kill any of the mobs. ([i]this is the only \"tricky part\" due to the game camera shifting point of view from Razorgore to yourself when MC channeling ends. However, don't panic, you will have a second or two to click again on the orb and re-establish MC. If you wait too long, Razorgore will enter the pile of mobs on you and the risk is one of them will attack him too.[/i])\n\n6. The mob spawns have a limit and you will see that no more run out after a while.\n\n7. When no more mobs are running out - but are still piled on you at the orb - walk Razorgore around and kill the eggs. The mobs won't touch him.\n\n8. You won't be able to kill all the eggs in one MC so when the MC runs out, make sure Razorgore is at the opposite end of the room and then re-MC.\n\n9. When the last egg is killed, the mobs will vanish/run out of room and you can fight Razorgore.\n\n[b]NOTE: do not kill any of the mobs or they start re-spawning and will attack Razoregore.[/b]\n\nIt took me about 15 attempts following all the other advice methods here and then by chance I read about this method on battlenet forums.

When you get a dragonkin on you, lull it to sleep with spell \"5\"\r\n3.) Let go of the boss with escape or the red arrow and AoE the mobs around you. And depending on your character, throw a HoT on yourself. That will help aggro stay on you\r\n4.) Don't let go of Razorgore near the end. The aggro shift won't do much after you've gotten to a certain point\r\n5.) [b]DO NOT[/b] attack him until he heals himself. If you do, he will reset and kill everybody.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.

Take control of Razorgore and make your way to the platform your character is on - do NOT destroy any of the eggs on the way\n\n3. Destroy the two eggs on the platform your character is standing on\n\n4. After destroying those eggs, quickly get as far into the back of the wall as you can with him on that platform, like full on wall clipping\n\n5. [b]Tilt the camera until you have a top down view[/b] - this will make the next step SO MUCH EASIER, because the camera angle stays the same between your character and Razorgore. It's way faster and easier to find the control orb within the sea of mobs that spawn when you're looking directly down rather than from the side\n\n6. Take control of Razorgore and let the mind control spell channel complete at least four times. This will draw out all the mobs that spawn and concentrate them around your character. You have a second or two to click the orb and restart the mind control before Razorgore is in aggro range of the mobs. Be sure to move him back to the back after each channel.\n\n7. After four complete channels, all the mobs should have spawned. On the fifth channel, take Razorgore around them and begin destroying eggs, but keep an eye on the duration of the spell\n\n8. Before the channel runs out, be sure to tilt the camera directly overhead to take over again faster, then keep destroying eggs as Razorgore\n\n9. Once all the eggs are destroyed, run around the room and wait for all the spawned mobs to vanish before one-shotting Razorgore, or there's a chance he'll despawn IIRC\n\n10. Despair that that mog you wanted hasn't dropped\n\n- There's a hard limit of how many mobs get spawned, but they spawn to replace each other on death. [b]Don't kill any spawning mobs[/b], it's a pointless exercise and they don't even drop loot\n- One or two mobs following you is fine, you'll kill all the eggs long before they kill you. More than four, consider forcing a wipe rather than suffer through dying as you walk to the last egg \n- If you screw up, it takes about a minute or two for the eggs and Razorgore to respawn\n- Keep calm; the most difficult part of this whole thing is finding the control orb when you're surrounded by 40-ish angry enemies.

Literally just finished soloing this guy, his body hasn't even despawned yet. \n\n1. Kill the three mobs by the orb. (edit, or don't. Your choice. I do it out of habit)\n2. Click the orb, taking control of Razorgore.\n3. Take Razorgore across the room to the platform your character is on with the orb. Attack only the two eggs that are on this platform with you.[u] Do not attack any eggs on the way there. [/u]\n4. Park Razorgore so close to the wall at the back of that platform that he clips through it. \n5. When the timer runs out the first time, quickly leap off the platform. You can still reach the orb, so click on it again and put Razorgore back in the wall. This drags the mobs who've spawned down with you and away from Razorgore.\n6. After two/three full channels, all the mobs that are going to spawn should have spawned. [u]Do not attack them at all, as yourself or as Razorgore. [/u]\n7. Start destroying eggs, reclicking the control orb as needed. \n8. When all the eggs are destroyed, allow all the spawned mobs to leave the room before engaging Razorgore, because IIRC there's a chance his kill will not count if you kill him before the final phase of the encounter officially starts on their exit. \n9. Collect your loot, dying a little inside as the mog you wanted didn't drop again. \n\nYou should only kill a few things in this room - the three mobs at the start possibly and Razorgore. There is [u]no[/u] point in killing the summoned mobs and if you're 110 you have literally nothing to worry about. You'll just summon more.\n\nDoing this method, half-assed as I was on youtube in the other window, I ended up with only a single mage following me around, which left me at a comfortable 75% HP on Razorgore.
