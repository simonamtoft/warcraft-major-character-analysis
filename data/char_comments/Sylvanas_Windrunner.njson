If Sylvanas survived the Third War I would presume that she would be a blood elf by now.\n\nThe blood elves did not feed upon the the corrupted Sunwell. The corrupted Sunwell was the greatest danger to the remaining blood elves so Kael'thas planned to destroy it which he successfully did by dispersing the corrupted energies (the remaining pure energy manifested to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=26046]Anveena[/url] by the red dragon Korialstrasz). Kael'thas then accepted Illidan's offer of magic source which is fel magic. It is fel magic that has set these blood elves apart from the other remaining high elves scattered in Azeroth.\n\nYes the high elves do feed upon arcane currents but only to ease their agony of being addicted to magic and definitely not from the Sunwell, at least not anymore (although this could change prior to the 2.4 events). They naturally have blue eyes and the arcane energy has nothing to do with it. They are not limited to having blue eyes (i.e. Alleria Windrunner and her half elf son [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16886]Arator[/url]).\n\nBlood knights are technically paladins. And Blood Knights are basically the equivalent of the Knights of the Silver Hand. The main thing to note is the blood elves' source of holy energy: holy energy that lingers from the magisters who previously \"tended\" the captive naaru, [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=25741]M'uru[/url] (used to be directly from M'uru pre-2.4). As for the high elves, it would be purely from Light just like all Alliance paladins.\n\nBoth blood elves and high elf npc's have the same models so there's no difference in their ears. Maybe you were talking about the night elves or the rare highborne.\n\nSo in conclusion, yes Lady Sylvanas was a high elf not a blood elf (whom are non existent at the time she was still alive anyway). But if Lady Sylvanas Windrunner changes models, she would look like a blood elf model which is the same as the high elf npc models.

She kept this discovery from Arthas and Kel'Thuzad while continuing to serve. The dreadlords contacted Sylvanas and explained that they knew the cause, and arranged a secret meeting with her. They told her that Ner'zhul's\u2014and by extension Arthas'\u2014powers were beginning to diminish. The nathrezim intended to use this opportunity to seize control of Lordaeron. Sylvanas tentatively agreed to assist, but under the condition that her aid would be provided on her own terms.[5] \r\n\r\nThe dreadlords planned on killing Arthas within the capital, but Sylvanas created a contingency plan in the case of Arthas' escape. She arranged for her banshees to feign allegiance and escort him to a place in the woods where she would be waiting for him.[6] After Arthas survived the dreadlords' ambush and escaped the capital, Sylvanas' loyal sisters saw him to the arranged place, and then killed his bodyguards.[7] \r\n\r\nSylvanas, hiding in the shadows, struck him with an arrow she had crafted \u2014 a venomous sting that would paralyse him. Arthas was furious at her betrayal, and demanded that she finish him. But Sylvanas refused to show him the mercy of a quick death and intended to make him suffer \u2014 as he had made her suffer in undeath. She was about to begin her grisly work when Kel'Thuzad arrived and intervened, killing her banshees and chasing her off.[7] \r\n\r\nArthas left for Northrend, having been summoned by the Lich King, and Kel'Thuzad went into hiding.[7] Sylvanas and her sisters were freed, but Sylvanas was still troubled. Though free from Ner'zhul, she and the other free-willed loyalists remained monstrous abominations in appearance.[8] \r\n\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as Varimathras arrived on the scene. The dreadlord invited the banshee to join him and his brothers in their new order. But Sylvanas was not so quick to relinquish what freedom she had just gained. She told him that her assistance was enough, and demanded to be left alone. Varimathras ominously warned that those who were not part of this new land would be cast aside, and that she had best not vex the new rulers of the Plaguelands. Sylvanas was adamant. As Varimathras departed, Sylvanas knew that an attack was imminent. But with only her banshees and some lesser undead to serve for her, Sylvanas was certain that she would soon fall. She needed to acquire an army.[8] \r\n\r\nScouting the outer wilderness, Sylvanas found a plethora of creatures who would serve her well, and with her banshees at her disposal, they would have little choice in the matter. She sent out her banshees to possess Mug'thol the leader of the local ogres, the Bandit Lord Blackthorn, the gnoll ruler Snarlmane, and the Murloc Puddle Lord. Those she did not possess were killed. With so many new allies, Varimathras was quick to fall before her. But after she defeated him, Varimathras begged for his life, saying that he could serve her well. He knew his brothers' tactics, and where their bases were located. Sylvanas knew trusting such an insidious creature was a risk, but felt that she could control him enough for her purposes.[8] With Varimathras' assistance, they moved against Detheroc's forces.[9] \r\n\r\nDetheroc had acquired a human puppet, Garithos, and his men, and was using them to protect himself. Sylvanas had his scouts possessed, and then infiltrated his base while their guard was down. As they slept, Sylvanas swept through the twin bases and slaughtered any before her. Though they eventually awoke and raised the alarm, it was too late. Sylvanas disabled the humans and ravaged Detheroc's forces, eventually coming to the dreadlord himself, and killing him swiftly. With the dreadlord dead, Garithos was freed from his mental control. Sylvanas saw him as arrogant and foolish, but felt that she could use him. She lied and promised to relinquish control of the Capital to him if he helped her kill Balnazzar.[9] \r\n\r\nGarithos attacked from the rear entrance to the city as Sylvanas and Varimathras came from the front. As they moved into the city, Sylvanas found caches of items left by the Lordaeron royals, and used them to further the assault. Despite the dreadlord's demonic allies, his forces were destroyed, and, as a final test of loyalty, Sylvanas demanded that Varimathras kill Balnazzar. Varimathras froze, saying that it was forbidden for one Nathrezim to kill another. But she required Varimathras to prove his loyalty to her. Varimathras obeyed, and struck down Balnazzar.[10] However, whether by accident or design, Balnazzar survived, later re-emerging as a leader of the Scarlet Crusade. Varimathras was not so reluctant when Sylvanas ordered him to do the same to Garithos.[10] \r\n\r\nWith all their enemies dead, Sylvanas made a proclamation to Varimathras. They would rule the Plaguelands as the Forsaken, and would stake out their own destiny, where none would get in their way", "date": "2009-07-03T00:28:30-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

So maybe arthas wont go down so easy either. And on a side note, if Blizzards going with warcraft realism, Arthas owned illidan in frozen. So he should be ALOT harder to kill, relatively speaking.

Illidans forces are kicking the living snot out of him the whole last lvl, and in the cutscene ARTHAS gets knocked prone and as Illidan is leaping in for the kill, he crawls and lets a last second desperate swing with Frostmourne, gets lucky and connects and Frostmourne tears Illidan open at across the chest knocking him back and down wounded, giving Arthas enough  time to lift himself back up and run like a scared little rabbit... haha so by any means he didn't own Illidan he got lucky, and then allowed himself to be further possesed by the Lich King. Aka Arthas is a wimp, and the Lich King is the one to worry about as he's a Demi-lich (of sorts in the way they present it), who's power is basically trapped in his armor/sword, so because Arthas don's his body, Arthas is merely a pawn/vassal.

Many of the Forsaken were residents of Lorderon in life that were viciously murdered and raised as Undead by Arthas' Scourge. When Arthas fled to Northrend permanently, he left the Undead of Lorderon behind. Sylvannas took over, and as the city proper was pretty well destroyed and no longer really defensible, she moved the whole thing underneath to the old catacombs and sewer system. This is now known as Undercity.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as Lorderon was once a human settlement, the Alliance feels that they have a claim to the old kingdom, and the Undead should be kicked out or better yet, destroyed. As Sylvanas puts it, \"The Alliance does not recognize our rights. They claim this land as their own while attempting to invalidate the claims of the founders of this kingdom.\" After which she bellows, \"I will never allow it...NEVER!\" \r\n\r\nInterestingly, in spite of her endless burning fury over her own fate and the fate of her people who died and were raised as Undead, she has no problem at all with using many of the Lich King's tactics. She orders the murder of innocent humans with plague using Valkyr to raise them again whether they want to or not. This has caused alarm among the heads of the Horde, and even Garrosh Hellscream, an orc known for loving a good round of war, blood, and mayhem, finds this repulsing and unacceptable. He even asks Sylvanas point blank what the difference between her and the Lich King is. She coyly responds that she \"serves the Horde,\" which was not an answer well received by Hellscream. \r\n\r\nCurrently during Cataclysm time frame, she is busy trying to slide her agenda underneath Hellscream's watchful eyes and create more Forsaken for her army any way she can.", "date": "2011-08-01T14:39:24-05:00", "rating": 21, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Spoilers.\n[spoiler]\u2022 She knows about Bolvar.\n\n\u2022 She admits that she treated the Forsaken as only weapons when she said \"Those who served me were tools. Arrows in my quiver.\"\n\n\u2022 After she commits suicide, she makes a pact with the Val'kyr to be resurrected. The Val'kyr wanted to make the pact so that they would no longer need to serve Bolvar, who may never wake up or he may wake up and choose a path they didn't like. Now the Val'kyr are bound to her instead of the Lich King and they will act as extra lives for each time Sylvanas dies.\n\n\u2022 The Val'kyr gave her a vision of the Alliance managing to take back Lordaeron. This was probably a vision of the future if she had remained dead.\n\n\u2022 Sylvanas had realized that she should no longer treat the Forsaken as weapons, but as \"a bulwark\", which is a type of shield. She doesn't want to stay dead anymore. \"She saw [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAIrj_Vqdfc&t=0m37s]only darkness[/url]\" when she had died as an undead.\n\n\u2022 She got to see the [url=npc=32497/matthias-lehner]child version of Arthas[/url] while in the darkness.[/spoiler]", "date": "2011-10-02T17:06:44-05:00", "rating": 23, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2014-04-14T14:56:55-05:00", 8, "Quench"]}

The high elven population was separating politically and ideologically even years before the third war. \r\n\r\nFor starters, the high elves were never happy join the rand alliance in the second war. They sent just a small contingent to fullfill their oath with the Arathi bloodline, just when Quel'thalas was in peril they went all in. But after the war ended, they retreated as fast as they could pick up their things. The High elves as a political entity where never all that into the alliance, so when the war ended, most of them returned to their homeland without even looking back. Justifiable or not, the fact is that, as a nation, they severed their short lived new alliance with the, well, grand alliance (redundancy!) having fullfilled their oath. \r\n\r\nAfter the Second War, the High elves were pretty much independant, not caring about the human nations, happy in thei magical kingdom. But there were a lot of elves, who fought alongside the humans in the war, that decided to continue their support. Alleria and her rangers, Veressa (she was getting human booty) all the high elves on Dalaran, the elves on the Lodges (maybe, but there were also veri independent and stranded from Silvermoon Comand) and pretty much any other that decided to stay on live on a human nation. These were the high elves that always remained loyal to the alliance, their ideology now different from their homeland brothers, who prefered isolation pretty much Gilneas style.\r\n\r\nEnter the Third War about 13 years later, when Quel'thalas got royally screwed, and then Dalaran. A lot of always alliance loyal queldorei followed Jaina to Kalimdor, others head south to Stormwind. The surviving elves of Quel'thalas (which I can't stress enough, hadn't been part of the alliance for more than a decade!) renamed themselves the blood elves in honor of the fallen. Their best chance of survival, join the alliance again. That didn't pan out at the end, and the Blood Elves under Kael'thas command at the time of the falling out with the Alliance (Racism, Naga, Death penalty, Garithos and all that jazz) headed out to Outland, with a large part (the sick, the old, the young and the defenders) remaining in the devastated realm of Quel'thalas. Then Kael send Rommath back to Silvermoon with promeses of power, and the surviving elves of Quel'thalas started using demon magic and rebuilding their kingdom. Then seeking the support of the Forsaken (lead by their former Ranger general) to join the New Horde (Now with less evil,less bloodlust and more acceptance!) to protect themselves againts the dangers of the post-war world.\r\n\r\nThe high elves as a nation, in their history, allied themselves with the human nations just out of necesity, not because they were such good friends and loved each other. But there a lot of high elves that really did care about the humans and remained loyal to the alliance after the Second War, those are the ones we see today in the human nations, the 7th Legion and the Silver Covenant, the ones that NEVER left the alliance when Silvermoon retreated after the Second War.\r\n\r\nAny elf that died protecting Silvermoon in the Third War would be horde (Koltira and the Dark Rangers for example) without thinking it twice, because their loyalty was always to their kingdom, their alliance with the Alliance barely footnotes in their story, even more to the more secluded ones that never left Quel'thalas in the Second War. They didn't care about the human nations, and had really little reason to do so, they were just allies out of necesity, just as they are now with the horde, because they have always been a very independant nation.\r\n\r\nI can't stress this enough, the high elves were never truly loyal to the alliance (like the dwarves or the gnomes) they share little beyond common enemies, and the high elves really loved their seclusion. But that doesn't mean that there weren't some elves truly loyal to the alliance, that remained after the Second War, and now see with horror the questionable choices that their homeland brothers have made.\r\n\r\nIn short, the political separation between the now Blood elves and high elves started in the Second War, and they both consider each other traitors. Because at the end, it's nothing but a matter of political stance. Should all the elves be loyal to Silvermoon Command no matter what desitions and alliances has made in times of peril? or, Should the elves that always remained loyal to the alliance stand by their long time allies, or stand by their people?\r\n\r\nI believe that neither party is wrong and have their reasons, but they resent each other for those same reasons.", "date": "2011-07-12T02:24:31-05:00", "rating": 10, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I agree, and I want to add something you've left out; after Quel'thalas had been rebuilt, Lor'themar banished those elves who refused to accept Illidan's methods of harvesting magic from living things and demons; supposedly his reasoning was that 'he couldn't rule a kingdom divided.' Needless to say, those high elves remained very bitter against him for that decision, and, tbh, I think this is bad writing in the first place, but I guess it is official lore.
