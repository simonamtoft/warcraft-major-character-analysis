Though slowed somewhat by the weight of age, Cairne still possesses great strength and valor. This great hearted giant knows that his people are in grave danger of extermination from the marauding centaurs. However, he has never given up hope of one day finding a way to lead his people to a new land where they can make their home and live in peace. \r\n\r\nHowever, between the centaur marauders savage attacks on his people and their hunting of local game to near extinction, Cairne planned to relocate his tribe to the verdant lands of Mulgore. But with centaur attacks growing more and more frequent, Cairne knew that on the open plains they would not be able to defeat them, and he quickly began to lose hope. \r\n\r\nThings changed when Cairne met Thrall, the young warchief of the new Orcish Horde, and, watching him battle and destroy a group of centaurs who had been attacking a Tauren, he became intrigued with their nobility and savagery. When Thrall told him that they came to look for their destiny, Cairne directed him to the north, where there was an Oracle. \r\n\r\nThrall reported seeing an army of centaur going north, and Cairne quickly left to defend his village. Thrall brought his followers with him, and followed Cairne to defend the village. After defending against wave after wave of centaur warriors, Cairne told Thrall of his plight, and Thrall vowed to protect the caravan of Tauren as they crossed the barrens to Mulgore, in exchange for the location of the Oracle. \r\n\r\nCairne and Thrall managed to evade and defeat the centaur marauders, and finally made it to Mulgore. Cairne told Thrall that the Oracle was within Stonetalon Peak, and bid him good luck. \r\n\r\nUpon arriving at Stonetalon, Thrall was surprised to find that Cairne had sought him out, and pledged to repay the debt they owed Thrall and the Horde. Cairne enlisted the wyverns to help them, and helped to free them from the harpies. He then helped to claim the peak from the humans so that they could enter freely. However, Jaina Proudmoore entered first. \r\n\r\nCairne and Thrall split upon entering the bowels of Stonetalon, and Cairne found an enchanted spirit stone that would activate an ethereal bridge towards the Oracle. When they found the Oracle, Cairne and Thrall found Jaina already there. All three spoke to the Oracle, who told them that they must all ally if they wished to defeat the Burning Legion. The three hesitantly agreed. \r\n\r\nCairne's wisdom and strength, and the power of his tauren warriors, helped Thrall to reclaim Grom Hellscream. In a combined effort, the sorcery of all three races were needed to purge the demonic influence from Hellscream. \r\n\r\nUnited in arms, Cairne pledged the loyalty of his race to the Horde, and together, they managed to defeat the Burning Legion once again. \r\n\r\n Cairne Bloodhoof in World of Warcraft.Cairne helped the orcs establish their new nation of Durotar before bidding them farewell and leaving to take his own people to a new land in Mulgore. There, they established a strong defense against the centaurs and harpies who harassed them. Several months later, however, Cairne's son, Baine Bloodhoof, was captured by centaurs. Cairne feared the worst, and slipped into a lethargic depression. His followers scrambled to lead their people adequately, but they were no substitute for Cairne's wisdom. His second, Tagar, tried to help Cairne, but Cairne would not hear of it. Tagar feared that without the leadership of Cairne, the tauren would not last long. \r\n\r\nWhen Rexxar and Rokhan arrived to ask Cairne for the tauren's assistance in the coming battle against Admiral Proudmoore and his Kul Tiras forces , Cairne told them to leave him and tell Thrall that he had died. Tagar told the heroes of Baine's capture, and they quickly left to investigate his disappearance. With the help of Bovan Windtotem, they recovered Baine and returned him to his happy father. \r\n\r\nCairne, overjoyed, told Rexxar that not only would he pledge the service of his people to Thrall once more, he would be returning himself. He joined with Rexxar's band of warriors and returned to Dustwallow, and then helped to repel Proudmoore's forces. Victorious, they then took the fight to the humans and ended Proudmoore's reign of hatred. \r\n\r\nCairne returned to his people and his son in Mulgore. \r\n\r\nCairne also recognized that the nomadic traditions of Tauren society were a danger to the survival of the people. There were few tauren, and their wandering lifestyle meant that they would be vulnerable to attacks by Centaur, Quilboar and other races. With the help of the Horde, Cairne secured the grasslands of Mulgore as a permanent home for the Tauren, and constructed their first city high atop Thunder Bluff. \r\n\r\nThough Cairne is a gentle soul, and at an advanced age (he's currently 104), he can still fight ferociously when the need arises. It is rumored that Cairne would willingly turn over the rule of Thunder Bluff if he could find someone worthy, and spend the last years of his life in the wilds. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom World of Warcraft - Tauren Lore at BlizzPlanet.com: \r\n\r\nCairne Bloodhoof \r\nCairne is dedicated to serving his people and to watching over their safety in an ever-darkening world. An outstanding warrior, Cairne is considered one of the most dangerous creatures alive. Despite his strength and valor, he is a gentle soul who longs only for the peace and tranquility of the open plains. It is rumored that if he could lay the responsibilities of chieftain on another, Cairne would leave Thunder Bluff in an instant and retire to the wilds. Many believe that he is training his son, Baine, to take his place as chieftain one fateful day. \r\n[edit] Bloodhoof Runespear\r\n  This article or section contains information taken from the Warcraft RPG books which may not be found in other sources of lore.  \r\n\r\nEvery inch of this massive spear is carved with tauren tribal runes.

He has just over 1 Million health and several abilities that let him pack a punch, but nothing you can't handle without reading about it ahead of time.\n\nStrategy\n--------------\nTo start, you DO NOT want to run straight through the city to get to him.  This will cause an ungodly amount of guards to spawn.  Instead, come up the main elevator and immediately take your raid to the right, straddling across the edge of Thunder Bluff.   By staying on the right behind the buildings the entire time, it will take you directly behind Cairne's tent with no guards.  This is where you can buff and get ready.  (Be wary of the NPC on the left backside of his tent, they can spawn guards if someone gets to close.)\n\nAs soon as Cairne is aggroed, he will spawn a number of guards that's dependent on the amount of hostile players in his range.  Simply put, the more people you have, the more guards are going to spawn.  Thunder Bluff guards have a \"Backhand\" ability that knocks you down for a few seconds.  It's advised that you immediately rush Cairne into his tent so all the guards follow, then AE bomb them down.  Guards will respawn every 3-5 minutes as well, so make sure your AE group has enough mana to take care of it.  You'll be fighting Cairne in his tent, so make sure your raid members are positioned so that horde outside will not get an easy ranged shot from outside.  If horde do attack, do NOT venture outside his tent.  Reposition yourself where they cannot attack you.  Going outside will most likely cause more NPCs to summon more guards.\n\nYou'll want the tank/melee group to goto the right and all ranged attackers to the left.  The tank should have his back against the right wall of the tent, and the casters on the far left wall with lots of range between the two groups.  If all is going well, Cairne will not be doing big damage to the caster group at all.  The only damage they will take is from Berserker Charge (explained later) and spawning guards.  He will do a thunderclap every few seconds that hits for around 1k and slows attack/movement speed to all melee.  He'll also do a cleave that used to attack all melee in 360 degrees, but people said it now only hits targets in front of him.  In any case, only have the main tank standing in front of him.   Every 15-30 seconds, he will perform a berserker charge.  This ability is scripted to target the person furthest away from him every time, so it's always going to be a caster/hunter.  If you're not fighting him in his tent, this ability will most certainly knock that person off of Thunder Bluff and kill them from falling damage - this is why you are fighting him inside his tent.   \n\nThe melee group will be taking constant damage so healers will need to be prepared with mana potions - never take fewer healers than you need.  If something goes wrong it can be a long fight for an undergeared group.   Casters should heal themselves after each wave of guards or a beserker charge as healers will need to be concentrating on the tank and melee group.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 26, "id": 418226, "nreplies": 2, "sticky": 0, "user": "saTchmo", "body": "If anyone is looking to get Bloodhoof down at lvl 70 for the achievement I will provide a few pointers. This is easily doable if you take a few precautions. First is it has to be a 40 man raid, forget anything at all about doing it with less. Second people need to be SWP/BT/S4 geared at the very least. The advice in point form:\r\n\r\n- Raid at unconventional times. I arranged a single raid at around 02:00 which met two horde raids defending and failed. I thereafter arranged two seperate raids at 06:00 during two seperate week days and we got all 4 bosses down. Its taxing to get up that early but imo the bear is well worth it as is the letter from king Wryn.\r\n\r\n- Bring 8 tanks min. The tanks needs to stack as much hit into their gear while keeping above 20K hp. More or less you are looking for any mix of Feral/War/Pally tanks. Pally tanks have a better time if they get the glyph of Righteous Defense. The reason why you bring the 8 tanks is that due to Cairne being lvl 83 he will resist about 80% of your taunts. To make matters worse he will knock the current aggro target every once in a while removing them from the threat meters. You roll with 8 tanks to effectivly elimintate this problem by having all tanks just chain spamming taunts. According to WWS our tanks did around 900 taunts on the fight. Keep up misery on the tanks to give palas even more hit% and make tanks use hit food. If you can constantly have Cairne on a tank and have the healers keep the tank up the fight almost, but only almost, becomes trivial. Horde can pose a much bigger threat.\r\n\r\n-  Bring 10 healers min. Cairne hits like a truck and even more so on the switches. One healer should stay OOC and get in after the raid. He should stand at the back and res anyone who might die. This will happen if your extremly unlucky with taunt resists. If all 8 tanks fail to make the mark he will go over and most likely one shot the next person on the aggro meters (usually a hunter) but dont panic. Tanks will get him back and the OOC resser should just res the dead people. REMEMBER do not throw heals or anything else on the OOC resser or he will get into combat. If this should happen make him go in front of Cairne, get cleaved, die, cres him and he should be OOC again. Alternatively use a nelf with shadowmeld. \r\n\r\n- Stack your raid with phys dps. Hunters are best. Rogues, Warriors and ret paladins come in second. Mages, Warlocks, Shadows, Critchickens etc are horrible on this fight. Chances are you will bring some so make sure that any spell dmg classes stack as much hit as possible (think around 400)\r\n\r\n- Dismount before enteriing TB and kill all the guards along the way. Meet up in the small pit just before Cairns hut and get rid of all the guards. Pull Cairne, his bodyguards and any other guards that spawn INTO the tent. ALL tanks and Cairne should be heading left as they enter the tent behind the big \"log\" thing or pipe or whatever it is. All the ranged dps should head right all the way to that side of the tent and group there shortly after followed by the ooc resser. \r\n\r\n- Follow the above advice and its a tank and spank really. With well geared people it should take no longer than 15 - 20 mins to get him down. The things to keep an eye for is ofcourse the adds which will ocasionally spawn but even at lvl 75 they dont have much HP and can be AoEd down. Your worst enemy is a priest with guardian spirit. At the moment of this writing if an enemy priest throws guardian spirit on Cairne and you land a killing blow on Cairne while its active he will self res to 100%. The priest wont be flagged for pvp either so he can just stand there next to Cairne and wait till Cairne is on the last % and then more or less harras you. If its two priests or more you will have to pull of some pretty good DPS executions (both stop and burst) to not land a killing blow (guardian spirit is insta cast, lasts 10 seconds and is on a 3 min CD)\r\n\r\nBloodhoof is by FAR the hardest of the horde city bosses due to requiring so many tanks (its doable with 5 but will be way more shaky), general aggro reset and hitting the hardest of all the bosses. At the moment of writing we have killed him 3 times (the first two times we killed him and he self ressed due to Guardian Spirit bug since we at that time didnt know there was one or even noticed he had the buff (we thought he had bugged out)) and while the first two were with 5 tanks and it is doable the last kill was a text book execution with him only gibbing one DPSer compared to several on the two previous \"kills\". If you roll with less tanks be prepared for lots of deaths (theoretically it might be possible with 4 tanks) so bring along a repair bot or two to drop down during the fight so people can repair.\r\nSeeing as my own guild is a diverse bunch who dont feel the need for achievements or doing crazy stuff like this, the raid I ended up leading was an amalgm of the best guilds on our server with each guild being represented with a few people and I belive this will be the way to go for most people as those coming will be the prepared ones. Flasks, pots and otherwise are advised since they are dirt cheap anyways.\r\nAlso raid leading is a plus if you are attempting this. Doing LFG 39 more for Bloodhoof isnt going to cut it :)\r\n\r\nHope this helps anyone who is planning to gun for him. I found arranging this raid and actually getting this boss down much more challening than what SWP can offer me at the moment. That and the bear is like totally cool :>\r\n\r\n- Ignatus of Infamous\r\n- Alliance \r\n- Outland EU server", "date": "2008-10-24T05:53:24-05:00", "rating": 18, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "According to WoWWiki's spell hit page [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Spell_hit]here[/url], level 70 casters have a -27% chance to hit with spells against a level 83 target.

Some changes were made recently that may ward away some allies from the generally unpopulated TB.\n\nCairn now has 3 phases:\n\nPHASE ONE:\nCairn, once agro'd, will come towards the tank. This is the most straightforward phase. He hits for a ton, so healers must stay on their toes. However, this is not the key feature of phase one. every five seconds or so, Bloodhoof will call to his aid a group of six to ten Tauren Rogues. These are the most deadly rogues in the game, and they will be lurking for most of the fight. This is the only time, however, that they will become active.  You will need about 10 tanks and 10 healers, one for each, in order to take each of them down. All DPS should focus on the rogues. Be careful not to extend any AOE's beyond Cairn;s circle, otherwise you may agro other rogues hiding in the bushes and trees. An important thing to note is that if a Mage can manage to scorch one close enough to a fire, the rogue will turn into a tasty burger, which tanks can pick up at any time in order to gain a rather significant 5000 health bonus and increased benefit from heals for 30 seconds.\n\nPHASE TWO:\nWhen you get Cairn to about 60 percent or less, he will do a massive stomp and stun every raid member (make sure all rogues are dead by then, or they will turn that one stun into a stun lock that cannot be escaped). He will then say \"I have underestimated you, Alliance heroes! However, I must now put on my robe and wizard hat!\" Cairn will gain a gear set resembling Mage T2. He will then proceed to cast different hexes and spells:\n\nLv. 3 eroticism: Cast only on male members of the raid. When affected, they will take on the appearance of a real beautiful woman. During this time, they will lose approximately 40% of their health and be forced into a dress. This spell is a matter of luck, if your tanks are affected, it's the end. The only things one can do while in this form is create tailoring products and cook. The upside is that any tailors who gain this will not have to spend any materials to make even the highest-level and most expensive items, and any cooks experience an equivalent buff. You must not get close to Cairn, however, or else he will gain a stacking buff called \"solidifying\" which decreases all damage taken by 3% and heals him slowly. This can stack untill he is taking no damage and heals all his health every tick you are near him. One person is affected for the entire phase, others will have the debuff for 10 seconds.\n\nLv. 8 Totem of the Infinite: Cairn's totem gains potency never before seen on Azeroth. It will increase his chance to crit by 50%. Has a 3 second cast time, interrupt able. He will attempt to cast it ever 10 seconds or so.\n\nMighty Strike of the Beyondness: This attack will hit the secondary agro target, sending him/her flying into Azshara. Only cast once according to all reports, but bad DPS may see him cast it more.\n\nLv. 1,000,000 Lightning: Instantly turns any raid member under the max level into a fine bloody mist. Cannot be resisted or dodged in any way. Bring all 80's to Cairn. This spell is cast once every 50 seconds, give or take.\n\nPHASE THREE:\nThis is by far the most deadly phase. When you have Cairn down to around 13% health, he will throw aside his Totem Pole. Then, he will gain a buff called \"Imma Chargin' muh Laza!\" During this time, all the damage he takes is reduced by 75%. This is where EVERYONE needs to DPS as hard as they can. If left alive for 30 more seconds, Cairn will begin to Launch \"Shoop da Whoop.\" This attack spams, normally hitting for 4k but crit'ing for well over nine thousand. Anyone who is hit by this will immediately lose all durability on their headpiece, possibly killing it permanently. If the raid can kill Cairn before he fires his Laza, however, you will not need to worry about it.\n\nCairn has had a loot table added to him. There are only three items, and only one drops per kill:\n\"I Win Button\"\nBinds when picked up\nTrinket\nEquip: Increases spellpower by an amount equal to 150% of your level.\nEquip: Increases Attack power by an amount equal to 300% of your level.\nEquip: Chance on spell cast or melee strike to pwn, instantly winning at anything you are doing.

[b]SPOILERIFICATION[/b]\r\n\r\nThe Horde loves Garrosh. He made a big splash in Northrend commanding the troops there, and many Horde warriors believe (incorrectly) that he was the one who singlehandedly defeated the Lich King. And now, he's ready to head back to Kalimdor, along with most of his warriors. Varok Saurfang, tired of Garrosh, remains in Grommash Hold as part of the Horde's Northrend skeleton crew.\r\n\r\nCairne Bloodhoof arrives in Borean Tundra, acting as escort to the troops returning home with Garrosh. He's had little interaction with Garrosh before, but when kvaldir attack Garrosh's Landing, they're forced to work together, and Cairne learns much about Garrosh.\r\n\r\n[i]    Garrosh was a brilliant tactician, a fierce warrior, and loved by those he led.\r\n    He also held grudges, was a hothead, and needed to learn the lessons of both respect and compassion.\r\n    Cairne would speak with Thrall immediately upon their return.[/i]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle, the Horde ships make their way back to Orgrimmar but are beset by powerful, unnatural storms. Many of the boats are sunk, along with the soldiers and desperately needed supplies. Then, they spot an Alliance ship, nearly destroyed, drifting in Horde waters. Garrosh orders the ship destroyed, but Cairne immediately disagrees. It hasn't shown hostilities; it is clearly disabled. Garrosh instead orders the survivors brought to his ship. He destroys the Alliance ship, gives the survivors skiffs and tells them to remember that today, Garrosh Hellscream saved their lives, that he was their life and death.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Orgrimmar, a great festival is held, and Garrosh is presented with his father's axe, Gorehowl, by Thrall. Everyone celebrates the end of the Northrend campaign.\r\n\r\nBut not everything is great in Orgrimmar. Supplies are low in the already-unlivable Durotar thanks to extended droughts, and the night elves are so angry with the Horde after the Wrathgate incident that they've shut down all lines of trade with them. In a meeting with Orgrimmar leadership, Thrall notes that Ashenvale has a surplus of resources and that it'd be wise to get back on the night elves' good side. Garrosh says they should just attack them. Thrall and Cairne chide him, because post-Northrend, there's an Alliance-Horde truce. Hostilities have even ceased in Alterac Valley, Arathi Basin and Warsong Gulch. Garrosh politely but angrily leaves the meeting.\r\n\r\nAfter that meeting, Magatha corners Garrosh and tells him that he's just what the Horde needs and that he has the full support of the Grimtotem tribe. Garrosh accepts the compliment with some skepticism.\r\n\r\n    It was not a time to be cautious. It was a time to be bold. They would understand once he gave them results.\r\n\r\nWhen word of a night elf village in Ashenvale being destroyed gets back to Orgrimmar, it's assumed that Garrosh was the one who ordered it. He denies it. Hamuul Runetotem, on Thrall's urging, heads to Moonglade to try to negotiate with the night elves there, hoping that their status as druids will help matters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Thrall, who's getting ready to leave the Horde temporarily to learn from the elements of Draenor, appoints Garrosh as interim leader of the Horde. At first, Garrosh is worried that the position isn't right for him -- despite his earlier challenge to Thrall's title, he knows that it takes a certain kind of person to lead the Horde, and that perhaps he'd be more fit for something like military duty. Thrall assures him that he's the best choice\r\n\r\nAs Thrall leaves Orgrimmar for Draenor, Cairne stops him and tells him what a big mistake he's making by appointing Garrosh in charge. Cairne has some personal experience with Garrosh, and he can tell that he's too much like his father for his own good -- or the good of the Horde. Thrall tells him that if he thinks that Garrosh will mess up, he needs to act as his advisor. Cairne refuses. They part with angry words.\r\n\r\nWhen Hamuul reaches the designated meeting place in Ashenvale (Moonglade having been eschewed due to Remulos not wanting to get involved in mortal squabbles), both sides are attacked by a band of orcs and slaughtered. Hamuul is left for dead in a mass grave. We discover that the orcs who committed this crime and the one before it are Twilight cultists.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Hamuul, who managed to survive the attack, doesn't get that memo. He sends word back to Cairne that everything's gone to hell. Cairne gets the news and heads to Orgrimmar, thinking that it was Garrosh that ordered the attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]The Mak'gora[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cairne arrives in Orgrimmar, he backhands Garrosh right on his painful new jaw tattoo. Garrosh denies being involved with the attacks. Cairne is fed up with him and demands a mak'gora, a duel of honor for control of the Horde. Garrosh can't believe it. He makes a gambit, saying that if they're going to do mak'gora, they shouldn't do the more recent version, which is basically a \"say uncle\" kind of deal -- it should be the old mak'gora, a duel to the death. Cairne instantly agrees. Again, Garrosh can't believe it. They agree to meet in the arena.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the mak'gora state that each combatant is allowed a single weapon, and if they drop it, they can't pick it back up. They're allowed no armor, only a loincloth. And their weapons may be blessed by a shaman. A random shaman blesses Cairne's runespear, and none other than Magatha Grimtotem offers to bless Gorehowl. Unbeknownst to Garrosh, she poisons the blade.\r\n\r\nCairne beats the crap out of Garrosh easily. Garrosh manages to nick him on the chest with Gorehowl, and Cairne immediately gets faint. Garrosh attempts to hit him again, a weak blow to force him back, but Cairne can't defend himself and the howling axe sinks into chest. Cairne dies. Garrosh is bewildered.\r\n\r\n    [i]And so, I, who have lived my whole life with honor, die betrayed.[/i]\r\n\r\nThe moment Cairne dies, Magatha orders her tribe to begin a night siege on Thunder Bluff and the surrounding towns. They wipe out nearly every other tauren in the area. Baine Bloodhoof, who wasn't even yet aware that his father had died, is alerted by a Grimtotem defector that his life is in danger and they have to leave immediately. They cause a kodo stampede to distract the Grimtotem and escape.\r\n\r\nThe Grimtotem defector heads to Ratchet while Baine contacts Garrosh for help. Gazlowe agrees to supply Baine with a huge amount of supplies and explosives -- for nothing. (He always liked \"the old bull.\") Meanwhile, Eitrigg tells Garrosh that he needs to man up and atone for what he did, intentional or not. Garrosh agrees, still reeling from the death of an old tauren he didn't even necessarily dislike.\r\n\r\nMagatha, who had sent word to Garrosh as well, asking for help in the face of Baine's forces, is greeted by the following message:\r\n\r\n[i]    Unto Elder Crone Magatha of the Grimtotem,\r\n    Acting Warchief of the Horde, Garrosh Hellscream\r\n    Sends his most sincere wishes for a slow and painful death.[/i]\r\n\r\nShe electrocutes the messenger.\r\n\r\nWith Garrosh's and Gazlowe's help, Baine takes back Thunder Bluff from the usurpers and captures Magatha. He doesn't kill her, instead sending her to live alone in Stonetalon, saying that if he ever sees her again, he'll kill her. Garrosh expects Baine to challenge him as well, but Baine tells him that Cairne meant to help the Horde with the mak'gora, and that another challenge wou", "date": "2010-10-19T12:19:53-05:00", "rating": 28, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Just a few correction on your otherwise very good summation :)  The attack by Garrosh was on a supply patrol, and not a village.

He cannot leave the Horde without a warchief and appoints Garrosh Hellscream as its acting warchief until he returns.\n\nCairne disbelieves that Garrosh is a good choice but goes along with it but once the treaty between the Alliance and Horde which was made just after the Lich King fell is broken as Ashenvale took an attack on the lumber the Horde were originally harvesting and some of the Night Elf sentinels were butchered in their defense.\nThen when the Cenarion Circle under Cairne's request meet to resume lumber trading in Ashenvale they are attacked by orcs from the Twilight Hammer who disguise themselves as orcs from the Horde. \n\nWhen Cairne finds out about this he believes that Garrosh was behind both these incidents he storms in on Garrosh and challenges him to Mak'gora which is a duel with just a weapon, no armor and a blessing but Garrosh raises it to the orcish old ways; fight to the death.\n\nUnknown to Garrosh his \"blessing\" from the Grimtotem Magatha was poison that with one cut would kill instantly. This was the plan that Magatha was waiting for to reclaim Thunder Bluff as her own and stealing the honor from Garrosh as he knew nothing about it.\n\nWhen Garrosh and Cairne's weapons collided during combat, Gorehowl shattered Cairne's Runespear and he took a small graze to the chest. Soon after started to feel weak and looked like his old age was getting the better of him which Garrosh didn't think anything of delt the killing blow. Thinking he was victorious until later revealed by Eitrigg what she had done to his blade.\n\nGarrosh saw that not only had Magatha stolen his honorable kill but actually threw the Tauren race into danger until Baine Bloodhoof thanks to the help of Lady Jaina Proudmoore, Andurin Wrynn  and the mace Fearbreaker (Given to Andurin by Magni Bronzebeard just before he turned to stone) reclaimed Thunder Bluff and banished Magatha and the remaining Grimtotem to Stonetalon Mountains where they will be killed by either wildlife or any passer-by who saw them.\n\nHope that covers it for you.. and hope I didn't spoil too much of The Shattering for anyone reading it (Good book though)", "date": "2010-11-05T10:51:29-05:00", "rating": 14, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-11-05T10:53:45-05:00", 1, "Swinyard"]}
