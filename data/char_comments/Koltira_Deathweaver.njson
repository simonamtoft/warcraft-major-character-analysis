He has no special abilities. Here's how to solo him as Ret:\r\n\r\n1. Use Seal of Light and Judgement of Light - with good gear this ought to heal you for over 1,500 per attack. You will need every bit of healing, as Koltira's melee hits are very unforgiving.\r\n\r\n2. Get lucky with dodges and parries. Every avoided attack is 6k more health you have.\r\n\r\n3. Be well geared - I'm talking 5k AP with Blessing of Might and 32% + critical chance. Hit rating and expertise are necessary, as well.\r\n\r\n4. Use Flash of Light ASAP when you get Art of War - with the above gear level you ought to be hitting 4.5k-5k Flash crits, with a powerful HoT also helping keep you alive.\r\n\r\n5. He IS vulnerable to stun. This is crucial, as even with all your self healing you will inevitably drop closer to 0 health. Stunning him with Hammer of Justice allows you to get in several melee attacks, healing you for a significant amount. Improved Hammer of Justice helps, but is not necessary.\r\n\r\n6. You will probably need to bubble or LoH. I recomment LoH, as your mana will probably gradually deplete, and LoH also has the potential to crit and put up a powerful Sheath of Light HoT.\r\n\r\n7. Don't forget Sacred Shield - this is a no brainer. ~1800 damage mitigated every 6 seconds and a buff granting you 50% crit chance with Flash? Yes, please.\r\n\r\n8. Clear out Koltira's ENTIRE room before pulling. Kill the Kor'kron Elites, then pull the group to the right of the entrance. Once they are dead, run out of the room and to the front of the ship  where there is a window into his room - pull the remaining elite and normal mob. Note that Koltira will is not linked to these mobs, but they ARE linked to Koltira. After they are all dead, pull Koltira from the front of the ship. I recommend an exorcism-hand of reckoning combo.\r\n\r\nLuckily Koltira's health pool for an important lore character is relatively low, 252K.
