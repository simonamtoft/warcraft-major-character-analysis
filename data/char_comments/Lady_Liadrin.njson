I.E. you get them to 0 HP and they do not die, they stand there and attack you for like 20 damage and annoy you. They disengage once you get far enough away, which is generally all the way back onto the street upstairs.\n*Horde can attack you from the channelers posts as well as from upstairs in the circle hole from the war room.\n*The Magister standing next to her is level 60 and does nothing special, just 2 shot him and get on with things.\n\n*Drops 50 - 100G (75G Average) and NOTHING else, no trash, no lint NOTHING just 50 - 75 G.\n*6 min respawn\n*1 Million HP and change\n*She does not Bleed, i.e. no rake, rip etc.\n\n*Getting there is easy: \nMount up and ride there - continue to ride once inside the city from Silvermoon main entrance and follow the main road right all the way. Once you get to Farstriders Square as the Road turns left you go to the building on the RIGHT in the CORNER with BLUE DRAPES. You do NOT want to go to the War Room, NOR do you want to go to the building straight north. You WANT TO GO to the entrance to the RIGHT with the BLUE DRAPES. \n*Also note, if you DO NOT go inside and downstairs once you get there, GUARDS will continue to respawn on the street upstairs. Champion Vrenesh also patrols as well as Arcane Guardians. So go DOWNSTAIRS FAST.\n\n*2 maned her feral druid and shaman, she hits for nothing. Took 50 minutes.\n*4 manned her got it down to 6 - 7 min\n*Ideal group is 4 man for money versus gold.\n2 man 50 min (37.5G/Hour)\n3 man 20 min (50G/Hour)\n4 man 8 min  (80.3G/Hour)\n5 man 7 min (69.2G/Hour)\n\n4 man thus nets the most gold per person with 80 G average per hour in practice around 75G/Hour per PERSON.\n\nI have taken several groups and farmed around 1500G off her in around 2 weeks of 2 hour intervals of farming her here and there. Then it got so boring everyone and myself included just stopped.\n\nHorde generally does not respond if you are farming her. I recommend being courteous to the paladins turning in their quests to her as you may make them call for help and then get horde engaging you if you are not. This has happened 1 time to me and 3 times I have had general Horde come from upstairs to see what the commotion is and intervene.  The war room IS above her so any horde upstairs doing BGs or Arenas may hear you. By and large about 25% of the time you will have some sort of Horde scuffle, BUT you will be in a group AND she hits for NOTHING, on a bare with 25Kish AC. SO you can have your bare or Warrior tank, Warriors tank this just as well did 5 or so with a Warrior, and everyone else can go and kill horde.\n\nIf horde becomes a problem you can kite her into the hallway, the 2 guards are level 20, and then you can best defend yourself against horde attacks from just the 2 entrances to the hallway.\n\nHer respawn is 6 minutes, so PVP had become welcome in my groups to break the monotony and provide a challenge. Your mileage may vary.\n\nI cannot stress enough how you need exactly 4 people, less will take too much time and more will simply divide the money up  over more people and the difference from 4 to 5 as far as speed to kill her is so minimal, 8 - 9 min down to 6 - 7 min.  with a static 6 min respawn, that 4 is an absolute must. You may be able to tweak it, and if you get massive DPS in there down her faster. In my experience it is the type of encounter that makes people lose interest fast and 2 hours is about as long as people stay. As WARLOCK is a PLUS for summons as people get bored and leave.\n\nPeople have also become leary as they feel it may be considered an exploit and/or harassment, another reason we allow paladins to turn in their quests, so as to not be griefing them to warrant warning from GMs.\n\nCurrently, she is a GREAT place to practice and test things out, pretty much a target dummy. I perfected my Cat Mangle, Shred, FB rotations on her as well as messed about with some tanking rotations. Note she does not bleed.\n\nTo increase speed, have the tank switch stances or go cat and tank until the healer has around 20% mana, then switch back to Def stance or bare. She hits for so little that the Paladin friend I farmed her with was healing me once every 30 seconds. Mana will not be an issue due to the long periods of regen available.
