One of the trickier bosses to solo at this level due to the fact that he spawns several Treants that are difficult to deal with due to the lack of Thunderstomp (available to tenacity pets at 44).\r\n\r\nMy approach for this battle was to burn the boss down while juggling the treant aggro between myself and my pet.  The damage from the treants is minimal, so by tanking the treants for a time while you heal your pet to full buys you enough time to down the boss.  The routine went roughly like this:\r\n\r\n- Pull boss with pet\r\n- DPS the boss down as hard as possible without drawing aggro\r\n- When pet is close to death (about 20%), use Mend Pet\r\n- Aggro will shift to you after a tick or two of Mend Pet; continue to DPS the boss as hard as possible\r\n- When your pet it topped off from Mend Pet, use Feign Death to drop aggro; continue to DPS the boss as hard as possible\r\n- Use Mend Pet on your pet when it's low (again, around 20%), pop the strongest potion you have (I suggest the strongest you're able to use - purchase at AH, they're relatively cheap).\r\n\r\nAt this point, you'll probably pull aggro, but the boss should be close to dead.  Tank the treants for as long as possible, while you burn the boss down to nothing.  If necessary, pop another Mend Pet on your pet, Feign Death and just let the pet DPS the boss down if it's still alive.\r\n\r\nWhen the boss is dead, some treants will still be left.  You'll have to do a bit of fancy footwork and kiting in order to be able to deal with these - I happened to be very low on health and had about 4-5 treants left after the boss was dead.  If possible, kill them or just kite with Cheetah until FD comes off cooldown and FD, leaving your pet to clean up the remaining treants.\r\n\r\nMy gear consisted of quest obtained greens and blues from WPL and 1K Needles - nothing special.", "date": "2012-03-07T15:38:49-06:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
