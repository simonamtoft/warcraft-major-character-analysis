After some trouble getting a response from the GMs, one finally explained that several of the older quest chains are no longer being supported. This doesn't mean that some parts of those chains don't continue to work; just that the whole chain is no longer guaranteed to work and parts of it may have been removed from the game altogether.\n\nIf you're trying to get one or more of these items or achievements, Captain Obvious recommends that you first find out if all the components are available rather than starting to grind away on one of the components only to discover that another is no longer working or no longer even exists, as I did.", "date": "2015-04-19T12:29:05-05:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2015-04-19T12:29:58-05:00", 1, "Wimbleton"]}
