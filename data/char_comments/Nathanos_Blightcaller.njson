He would offer you man quests, including [quest=27477] -- which has been unedited despite being given to a random Argent Dawn soldier (Note the lack of concern for your life). [npc=20354] was his past-self in Caverns of Time's Durnholde Keep.\n\nHe was the Champion of the Dark Lady, and when you reached around lv55-56 in vanilla (a big feat, but still a good 4-5 days away from 60 for most players) she would personally send you to him, where he would basically go \"Hope you're less useless than the last fools she's sent my way.\" I am not going to give his full lore here, but as far as I know he and Sylvanas knew each other before undeath, and she trained him (being they're both archers and all) and I always was curious that Forsaken couldn't be Hunters pre-cataclysm, considering he was basically a Forsaken Hunter and all.\n\nThere was also an Alliance quest to assassinate him, which seems to have failed (with indication that he feign deathed, which isn't unlikely of a Hunter after all).\n\nHe was also pretty loveable. He went from hating you and wanting you to die to ultimately giving you a quest to enter Stratholme and kill that giant abomination boss (Ramsey or whatever) who apparently was the one who personally killed Nathanos in the first place, leading to a heartfelt conclusion where he actually didn't hate you in the end, even saying that you are useful... At least, that's how it plays out in my dreams or so.\n\nHonestly, I think the fascination with him is that he actually seemed to care about you. Unlike NPCs like Nazgrim, who you saw as a Sergeant in Grizzly Hills, a Legionnaire in Vash'jir, and a General in Jade Forest - and yet he still wouldn't recognize you by name despite you spearheading all of his efforts - Nathanos is someone who immediately knew how useless you were, gave you impossible (read: group) quests to solo, and then eventually got a small amount of respect for you and is someone who would definitely know you the next time you saw him.

Order must be restored.\n\nGather an army, <name>. Return to the Plagues with your army and destroy the Blightcaller.\n\nI wish you luck, <name>. Truly, you will need it for this battle.[/i]\"\n\nNathanos was the first [i]and[/i] the last human to ever becoming a Ranger Lord - a high position within the high elves ranks and was [i]very[/i] difficult to achieve! While still alive, he was the disciple of Sylvanas Windrunner who were the former Ranger-General of Quel'thalas, who're now the Banshee Queen of the Forsaken. Nathanos himself was, as stated in the quest, a tactical genius and knew that turmoil and darkness was about to enclose onto Lordaeron. With this knowledge he sent his younger brother Thereas to the kingdom of Stormwind where he knew he'd be safe. As the vile scourge hit the lands, he'd defend himself at his house, but was slain by the mighty abomination Ramstein the Gorger. He then became a mindless servant to the Lich King, until he was freed from the grib by the Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner. He then took the name Blightcaller and was given the title Champion of the Forsaken. After this, he would spend his unlivingness at Marris Stead recruiting horder players/soldiers to deal with the animal corruption, the Scourge and the Scarlet Crusade.\n\nThe Alliance found him when SI:7 sent their five best agents to investigate Marris Stead, however, four [i][b]never[/b][/i] returned and the fifth that returned to bring the news ended up [i]dead[/i] in his bed three days later. When the alliance knew who were unliving there, knew the [b]threat[/b] that this man possessed to the alliance and wanted him destroyed.\n\nNote: His model has been updated, but his stats - [i]in my opinion[/i] - does not match the position he holds, sadly.", "date": "2016-01-16T18:17:39-06:00", "rating": 17, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "It looks like only this instance didn't get any new stats to go with his model.

I don't think there's much luck to it, just depending on the spec you have as loot spec. (my Paladin is Holy, I've put the loot spec on ret and got the 2h sword, my hunter is SV and got the gun when I'v put the loot spec on BM).\n\nI don't think there needs to be a list pers\u00e9 if you can think logically, then I mean, for those who have played Legion, think about the artifact weapons, what sort of weapon did each spec had? I think Blizzard has been basing the loot table from Nathanos onto that, that's why there ain't that much different sort of weapons.\n\nI might be a bit late with my comment, but maybe it helps for those who play mostly in weekends, but I made a list here of what I think (some specs I'm certain about) that each spec would get as loot, and for those who wonder, no Nathanos doesn't drop off-hands and shields, with the same basic logic that the artifact weapons that have an off-hand or a shield, those are linked to the main-hand weapon. For example; shadow priest, you can't use the off-hand without needing to equip the main-hand, or prot paladin, same thing, you can't use the shield without the main-hand.\n\nFor those who are missing the point, I'm still talking about artifact weapons from Legion.\n\nSo purely based on my theory, I made a list here with what I think each spec gets from nathanos.\n\nHunter: \nSV \u2013 Polearm\nBM \u2013 Gun\nMM \u2013 Bow\n\nShaman: \nEnh \u2013 agi 1h mace\nEle \u2013 int 1h axe\nResto \u2013 int 1h axe\n\nPaladin:\nProt \u2013 str 1h sword / str 1h mace\nHoly \u2013 int 1h axe\nRet \u2013 str 2h sword\n\nDK:\nBlood \u2013 str 2h sword\nUnholy \u2013 str 2h sword\nFrost \u2013 str 1h sword / str 1h mace\n\nDruid:\nBalance \u2013 int staff\nResto \u2013 int staff\nGuardian \u2013 agi polearm\nferal \u2013 agi 1h mace/agi dagger\n\nMonk:\nBM \u2013 agi polearm\nWW \u2013 agi 1h mace\nMW \u2013 int staff \n\nPriest:\nDisc \u2013 int staff\nHoly \u2013 int staff\nShadow \u2013 int 1h sword\n\nWarrior:\nProt \u2013 str 1h sword/str 1h mace\nFury \u2013 str 1h sword/str 1h mace\nArms \u2013 str 2h sword\n\nRogue:\nSub \u2013 agi dagger\nAssa \u2013 agi dagger\nOutlaw \u2013 agi 1h mace\n\nMage: \nArcane \u2013 int staff\nFrost \u2013 int staff\nFire \u2013 int 1h sword\n\nWarlock:\nAff \u2013 int staff\nDestro \u2013 int staff\nDemo \u2013 int 1h sword\n\nDH: \nBoth specs \u2013 glaive", "date": "2020-11-19T17:53:21-06:00", "rating": 6, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "feral \u2013 agi polearm", "creationdate": "2020-11-20T12:07:18-06:00", "id": 1408051, "rating": 1, "commentid": 3251048, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "DallMit", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Thanks for the list.
