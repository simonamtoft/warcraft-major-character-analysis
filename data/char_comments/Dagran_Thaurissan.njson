For casters, it all depends on whether or not he uses the anti-magic shield. So I dualspecced to arcane and popped Arcane Power and Icy Veins. I won, because he never had time to put up the shield.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo for casters trying to solo it, the key is to kill him before he can pop up his shield.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, if you want a way to get to him fast (just to get the achievement kill or for a quest)\r\n\r\n[b]Shortcut to the Emperor[/b]\r\n\r\nFor this method you WILL need the Shadowforge Key. In addition, a high amount of fire absorption, a health potion, bandages, and maybe a shield/damage reduction spell would help, depending on your level. As a mage, I just used ice bubble/fire ward. \r\n\r\n\r\n1) Enter the instance and take a left. Unlock the door.\r\n2) Walk down the hall and unlock the door at the end. You'll be in a long hallway\r\n3) Go right and pass through the gate. Continue along until you reach Lord Incendius. Kill him or not, then put on your shields and fire protection and jump off the west side of the platform that Incendius is on into the lava.\r\n4) Head north and a bit east, stopping wherever there's a platform to heal the lava damage. Watch out, because there are fire elementals in the lava that will attack you.\r\n5) Head to the Molten Core bridge and look for a ramp on the western end of it. Climb up, go to the hallway to the west, and take a right.\r\n\r\nNow, you've skipped almost all of Blackrock Depths.
