Killing all the adds that periodically spawn throughout the fight remove stacks of this buff. \r\n\r\nHave your MT charge in and tank Freya, she doesnt do a lot of damage, but enough that your tank could get killed if healers are side-tracked. This fight consists mainly of adds spawning, and the raid dealing with the adds. When we killed her, she spawned 6 seperate waves of adds, 2 of each type:\r\n\r\n-Ancient Protector (a large add with over 1mil HP in 10 man. The raid must be stacked under the mushrooms that spawn in order to avoid his silence aura.) He also throws out a debuff which works similar to that of phase1 of Lady Vashj, if you have it, move away from raid members. \r\n\r\n- Detonating Lashers (a bunch of small adds, they do not have a lot of HP and are untankable. When they die they explode for a solid amount of damage, so be careful when dealing with these). \r\n\r\n- Snaplasher, Storm Lasher and Ancient Water Elemental (Three adds who must be killed within ~12 seconds of each other, or they will come back to life. The Snaplasher becomes stronger and slower over time, the Storm Lasher does AoE lightning abilities, and the ancient water elemental does a frontal AoE attack). Note: On 25 man, I strongly reccomend having your tank kite snaplasher when he begins reaching ~40 stacks of his debuff (assuming elder ironbranch is dead). \r\n\r\n-Note: Throughout the encounter, Blessings of Eonar will spawn. They look like really funky trees that grow. if they reach full size, freya will drain them and heal her/ any adds alive for a large amount of HP. We assigned our two ranged DPS to be in charge of killing these ASAP on 10 man. (We assigned 5 ranged to deal with them on 25 man)\r\n\r\nThis fight is shockingly simple on 10 man. We just nuked the Protector, and AoE'd the Lashers. We also just AoE'd the 3 adds, although we made sure to kill them at roughly the same time. Once Freya's stacks reach 0, the adds will stop spawning, and the fight becomes incredibly easy. Merely DPS her down, kite her out of the roots on the ground which spawn (they explode and knock people back while dealing damage).\r\n\r\nGood Luck :)\r\n\r\nEDITED for Hard Mode (10 man) Info:\r\n\r\n1 Elder Alive: We left up Elder Ironbranch for our attempts for 1 Elder. The fight was still pretty basic, the healing becomes slightly more intense. We had our DPSers create a macro: \" /tar strength\" to target the Strengthened iron roots freya casts. The only change we made was the add tank (me) began kiting snaplasher once he began reaching ~40 stacks of his debuff. \r\n\r\n2 Elder: We left up Elder Ironbranch and Elder Brightleaf. In addition to the fast iron-root killing, we also had to worry about the beams of light spawning. Simply step out of them ASAP (if you're rooted in one, yell at people to break you out fast). The main phase of concern is the Detonating Lasher phase. We handled this by stacking in freya's melee range for the lashers. We AoE'd them down to approximately ~20% hp, then we had our hunter drop a frost trap and our mage nova them, we then ran away and began aoe'ing them down, if there were a few left alive out of the trap, we simply focus fired them down in between raid heals. \r\n\r\nAlso, during the Trio phase (Storm/Snap/Water Spirit), I reccomend having atleast 1 interrupt class focused on stopping Stormlasher's Stormbolt ability.", "date": "2009-04-19T03:04:10-05:00", "rating": 56, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Killing the ancient will remove 25 stacks of attuned to nature, killing the Detonating Lashers (all of them) will remove 20 stacks of attuned to nature, and killing the trio will remove 30 stacks.

Kite brightleaf out of sunbeams, kite stonebark around the tree when he has fists of stone, etc. Each drops ~180g so that's your loot.\r\n\r\nThe flower trash [i]is a nightmare[/i] to solo. It can be done, but it's nearly impossible due to the 90% damage reduction aura on the small flowers and their spam heals on the guardian lasher. I ended up kiting the pack I pulled around the main platform where auriaya used to walk, for 5 minutes chains of ice spamming the small adds so they'd be snared far enough away from the guardian lasher for its damage reduction aura to fall off, and let diseases kill them. Overall not recommended if you can avoid it. The other trash packs are nowhere near as annoying.\r\n\r\nYou need to do it in DPS gear. The incoming damage isn't too awful except when the detonating lashers come out, as their attacks are fire damage. Just AOE them all down and ignore the tree that spawns while they're out if it's in a bad spot, they should all die from cleave damage before it can heal them. When the Snap/Stormlasher + water spirit come out, I got the first two down to about 20K then burned the water spirit down as it flying off when at low HP can make killing all 3 together somewhat problematic, especially if a tree comes out. The ancient conservator is also easy and does nothing of consequence, he just melts. It's more or less tank and spank + kill trees as they spawn.\r\n\r\nThe last phase of the fight when there's no adds out is actually the hard part. Freya heals for 6000/sec, but only has 1.4M HP. However because of the 6K healing, you will need to do 10649 DPS over this 5 minute period to down her, which is actually quite difficult because there's next to no incoming damage to give you vengeance, and you still need to kill every tree that spawns plus avoid being knocked back by the seeds (more because of the lost DPS than the damage).

Your minion must also be under the mushroom!\nAncient Water Spirit, Snaplasher and Storm Lasher - they must be killed within 12 seconds of each other, otherwise they resurrect.\n10 Detonating Lashers - just AoE them down.\n[i]P2:[/i] After you defeat all the waves, just defeat Freya.

For starters, The hardest pack of adds are the ones that spawn at a set of 3. When these spawned, i popped cds, and set focus on the snaplasher one since he has the highest health. Its a good idea to kill that one first. also, you should interrupt the water-y one since he knocks you back and you might lose some dps there (also that's a good time to heal), therefore making them revive. you don't want that, but if it happens, dont panic, they will have 50% health and you can try again. (most importantly don't try to zerg the only one alive since they will keep respawning one by one.) \r\n\r\n Now for the exploding ones, nothing special here, just kill them carefully, since they explode and that might be lethal. Should be just a couple divine storms combined with inquisition.\r\n \r\nLastly, for the big one, you can pretty much not use any cooldowns and still kill it in time, if you of course don't let any eonar's gift heal him, (which in my case it happened, boom 200k-->800k health) he should be really easy, if you predict what mushroom path you are gonna take, of course avoiding the sunbeams also. It's a nice time to throw some heals when he casts the silence ability. (at the start)\r\n\r\n That's about it, don't forget to make a macro going like /tar eonar and below that /cast judgment, really helps. Also, when you pull freya and you prepare for the adds, collect some holy power, it really helps to get a good start. when the stacks fade, you can begin to relax, you only need to do some dps now, don't panic cause she heals, you are doing great, just avoid those roots she casts, every now and then. DON'T use seal of righteousness, it will be a problem at the 3 guys. use justice or truth instead. also try keeping hammer of the righteous buff up all the time, so you get beat up less.\r\n\r\n  And there goes my longest comment, hope it helps, good luck guys! :)\r\n                                                                                                           -Melissa, Genjuros EU", "date": "2013-06-09T19:46:19-05:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
