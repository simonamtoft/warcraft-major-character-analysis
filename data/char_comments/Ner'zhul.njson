You will have to dodge [spell=153240] when they spawn, but the range for each is only 4 yards, so it is easy to avoid.\n[npc=75966]s are adds that walk slowly towards the boss during [spell=153153], and will heal and buff the boss if they reach her before her channel of [spell=153153] is complete (it is 20 seconds long).  If the add DOES NOT reach her by the end of the cast, it despawns!\n\nPosition a player inside the circle of runes to be positioned to deal with the add when it spawns.\n\nThe best class to assign to the add is a [class=3].  [spell=109248] is extremely effective if used when the add spawns, with [spell=5116] following to keep it slowed until it despawns.\n\nAlthough I have not tested this personally, a [class=7] may be able to do the same with the use of [spell=108269], [spell=51485]/[spell=63374], and subsequently with [spell=8056] +/- [spell=51490].\n[b]\nTL;DR: Slow, root and stun the [npc=75966] add for the duration of [spell=153153] to avoid having to waste DPS on killing it.[/b]\n\n[u][npc=75829][/u]\n\nDuring [spell=153067], when purple pools spawn all over the ground and must be avoided, the use of the reflective abilities can put a MASSIVE DoT on the boss, thus shortening the encounter significantly.\n\nAbilities that work include:\n[ul]\n[li][class=7] - [spell=8177] with [item=41538][/li]\n[li][class=3] - [spell=19263] with [item=45735][/li]\n[li][class=1] - [spell=23920]/[spell=114028][/li]\n[/ul]\n\nTo make use of this, pop the appropriate reflective ability, and stand in a purple void zone until it disappears to put the DoT on the boss. Be sure not to stand in any other pools!\n\nThe WeakAura at the bottom of this post can be used to more easily track when [spell=8177] is active.  It can be modified for other abilities.\n\n[b]\nTL;DR: Reflect a purple pool onto the boss during [spell=153067] if you have such an ability.[/b]\n[u]\n[npc=76407][/u]\n\nDuring the [spell=154469], a [class=3] or [class=7] can COMPLETELY negate this mechanic, thus saving you a lot of DPS which would have been wasted on the [npc=76518] add.\n\nAbilities that work include:\n[ul]\n[li][class=7] - [spell=8177] with [item=41538][/li]\n[li][class=3] - [spell=19263] with [item=45735][/li]\n[/ul]\n\nTo execute this, when [spell=154469] starts, the shaman should use [spell=8177] (or the hunter use [spell=19263]) and then that player should STAND IN the purple ground effect [i]behind[/i] the [npc=76518] skeleton.  This will reflect the damage onto that add, thus clearing a space for your group WITHOUT even attacking it at all!  Keep in mind that the add will take a few seconds to die, as it needs to take a couple ticks of damage.\n\nAs [spell=154469] comes every 50-55 seconds or so, a hunter can handle two consecutive rituals, and a third if [spell=118675] is talented (if [spell=19263] is used early in the first [spell=154469], it should be off CD late in the third one).  A shaman can handle every [spell=154469] phase even with a glyphed [spell=8177].\n[b]\nNote:[/b] In theory, this should also work with [spell=23920]/[spell=114028], although I haven't tested it.  The uncertainty lies in the fact that 2 ticks of damage are required to kill the [npc=76518] add, so this ability [i]may[/i] not be enough.\n\nThe WeakAura at the bottom of this post can be used to more easily track when [spell=8177] is active.  It can be modified for other abilities.\n\n[b]\nTL;DR: Reflect the purple swirls of death during [spell=154469] to kill the adds and clear space very easily.[/b]\n\n[hr]\n\nBelow I've listed a WeakAura string that can be used to notify you when [spell=8177] is active.
