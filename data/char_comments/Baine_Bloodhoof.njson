No particular reason, i was just in the area. Then, i mooed at him. I queued up for a dungeon, and since i was there, i figured i'd just spam /moo at the guy out of boredom, Until...\r\nI became a spirit bird (Like the one at the tauren starting zone) and a portal appeared above me. I couldn't control the spirit bird so i was thrown through the portal and i was then in a loading screen.\r\nI wasn't able to grab any screenshots (Sometimes my buttons stop working and the only way to fix it is relaunching WoW, and i was afraid if i relaunched WoW i'd be removed from the zone) but i can do my best to describe it and if i can duplicate what i assume is a glitch i'll be sure to take some screenshots.\r\nIt looked very similar to Nagrand, but with no trees, rocks, or any clutter of that sort. Instead there were just... cows. They weren't named \"Cow\" though. They were named \"temp_cowlvl_cowbeast\"\r\nand, as the name implies, were classified as Beasts rather than Critters. Some of them looked exactly the same except slightly larger and looked like they were shadowformed, and were named \"temp_cowlvl_cowdmn\" and rather than being classified as Beast or Critter, they were classified as Demon. I'm assuming \"dmn\" is shorthand for demon.\r\nThe \"cowdmns\" made the voidwalker death sound when killed (Which is actually really difficult, as they all have upwards of 1mil health, but are still level 1 and do barely any damage)\r\nIt's relevant to note that all the cows had numbers at the end of their names \"cowdmn1\" \"cowdmn2\" etc. I'm guessing that this zone was scrapped at some point, possibly during the Burning Crusade (as the zone uses a bare Nagrand as it's base) and that the numbers are simply different versions that vary in health pools for testing purposes.\r\nNone of the cows dropped anything on death.\r\nThis whole time, i had a debuff called \"Baine's World\" and its description read \"Baine has flown you to the Cow Level.\"\r\nThe debuff lasted 1 hour in total, and once it ran out i was turned into a spirit bird again and flown in to an identical portal, after which i fell out of the sky in the normal world where i entered, and i fell so far i died.\r\n\r\nThe amount of times i mooed at Baine was roughly around 100-200, but i can't be sure as i wasn't counting at the time. Again, if i can replicate the glitch, i will post screenshots. If anyone else can manage to replicate the glitch, please post screenshots.", "date": "2014-03-20T03:27:50-05:00", "rating": -9, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
