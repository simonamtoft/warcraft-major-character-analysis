{"commentv2": 1, "number": 2, "id": 353626, "nreplies": 4, "sticky": 0, "user": "goblinego", "body": "Taken from Wowwiki but this makes you know much:\r\n\r\nFormerly led by Sen'jin on the Broken Isles, Rokhan joined Thrall and his Horde when he saved them from the Sea Witch and led them to Kalimdor. After the Battle of Mount Hyjal, the trolls settled on the Echo Isles off the coast of Durotar, but Rokhan remained in Orgrimmar as a scout for Thrall. When Rexxar came to Orgrimmar with Mogrin's report, Thrall asked Rokhan to accompany the beastmaster's trek through the wilds.\r\n\r\nRokhan and Rexxar found humans on the coast of Durotar after they got to the observatory in Gar'thok's Outpost, and when they reported to Thrall, he sent them back to find the outpost ruined, and the humans quite hostile.\r\n\r\nRokhan began to worry about his own people on the Echo Isles, and thought that perhaps they should come to the mainland to avoid any danger. Thrall agreed, and sent Rokhan and his band to the Echo Isles to warn Vol'jin and see them off the island.\r\n\r\nAfter destroying the battleships that blocked their path and lighting signal fires for the outlying village, Rokhan and Rexxar were sent to a summit in Thrall's place. When they were ambushed, Thrall, hoping to finish things peacefully, sent Rokhan and his friends to Theramore Island to secretly parlay with Jaina Proudmoore.\r\n\r\nWith Jaina's aid, they discovered the invaders were led by Jaina's own father Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, who was determined to wipe out the Horde in Durotar. Rokhan battled alongside Rexxar as they hastily traveled around the Barrens enlisting aid from their allies. Finally, the human and orc forces clashed in a titanic battle at Tidefury Cove, and when the orcs emerged victorious, they chased the humans back to Theramore. Rokhan helped to lead the raid on Theramore, and battled Daelin Proudmoore's elite forces beside Rexxar. After Proudmoore's defeat and the end of the war, Rokhan was honoured by his people and Thrall's.  \r\n\r\n\r\nYou know much now\r\n\r\nsome of he's quotes\r\n\r\n    * \"Whadaya mean, what kinda accent is dis?
