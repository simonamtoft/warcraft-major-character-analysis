Generally though, you wont really even see it rise before phase 2 unless you fail.\r\n\r\nUse 2 tanks, 2-3 healers (6-7 in 25man) and rest dps.\r\n\r\nCorruption debuffs:\r\n0-25%: Nothing\r\n25%: You gain some more corruption each second\r\n50%: You puke corruption in a cone in front of you, dealing damage and extra corruption to friendly targets in front of you. Just turn around\r\n75%: You spam shadow bolts at random raid members\r\n100%: You gain 100% extra damage, spells are instant, but you can not be healed\r\n\r\nCorruption is gained by getting hit by all add abilities, standing in dead add pool and continually in p2.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 (100-25%)\r\n\r\nBefore starting on abilities, do note that Cho'gall actually hits quite hard on tank.\r\n\r\nCho'gall himself has a bunch of abilities and he spawns adds which have some as well.\r\nWhen he mind controls players, instantly interrupt the MC'd players to stop the channel. The channel gives cho'gall damage buff that stacks every 3 seconds.\r\nThroughout the fight, he will summon fire and shadow elementals and absorb them, giving himself a self buff, shadow causes aoe damage to the raid on every melee hit, fire causes extra damage on tank and some fire appears on the ground.\r\nWhen he uses Cho'galls fury (lazer beamz!), switch tanks to lessen burden on healers.\r\nTank boss close to the north side portal in the room, as the first add spawns from it.\r\nWhen boss casts Fester Blood, small adds spawn from alive adds and pools spawned by dead adds, aoe them down from ranged, dont let them melee the raid.\r\n\r\nWhen the adds spawn, drag it under Cho'gall and DPS switch to it and some players rotate interrupts on the add (if it goes through, damage + corruption in aoe). Also dodge the shadow crashes the adds cast. When the add is about to die, drag it to the very top of the portal part of the room, kill it and move away. \r\nSecond add spawns on the other side of the room, either move Cho'gall to the other side of the room as well and kill the add there or just drag the add to the same side as the first one and kill it near the first one (helps with aoe in 10man).\r\nYou should aim for 3 add spawns before phase 2, 4 is perfectly doable but 3 is easy enough with good dps.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 (25%-0)\r\n \r\nWhole room fills with dark goo and everyone gains corruption each second. No more large adds spawn, but 4 tentacles spawn periodically which need to be interrupted and focused down quickly (the channel reduces all damage/healing done by 75%). Pop heroism and just burn Cho'gall before everyone dies to corruption. Pay attention to your own corruption as well, if you are close to 50, turn away from the raid to prevent huge amounts of raid damage/corruption.\r\n\r\nAnother boring boss design with a gimmick that doesnt do really anything and the boss itself just does a %^&*load of aoe damage.", "date": "2010-12-22T16:47:48-06:00", "rating": 38, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Changes to Cho'Gall [b]HEROIC[/b]  Health goes to 175m (25man)  On 25man, two corrupting adherents spawn instead of one.

Make sure to move from them as they cause corruption![/li]\n[li]In this phase Cho'gall will sometimes use two spells that do different things:\n[b][url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=81171]-Flame's Orders[/url][/b] (seen by Cho'gall absorbing a fire elemental)\nCho'gall deals an extra ~20,000 damage per swing so make sure the tank is topped. He will also spawn fire patches on the ground similar to the fire patches from the Dragon boss in Stonecore, or that the adds on the Beauty encounter in Blackrock Caverns do. These are easy to dodge and should be avoided to prevent  raid damage and corruption.\n[b][url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=81556]-Shadow's Orders[/url][/b] (Seen by Cho'gall absorbing a shadow elemental)\nAll this does is add a shadow AoE to each of Cho'galls strikes, it deals about ~15-20k damage and during our kill it only ticked about 3 times each time he used Shadow's Orders.[/li]\n[li]Throughout phase one [b]and two[/b] Cho'gall will cast [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=82524]Fury of Cho'gall[/url] which will put a debuff on the tank that lasts 45 seconds which increase damage done against the tank, so be sure to tank swap[/li]\n[/ul]\nThe most challenging thing during phase one is the adds that spawn from the blood of the adherents. When Cho'gall casts [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=82299/fester-blood]Festering Blood[/url], he spawns five [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45858]Congealed Blood of the Old God[/url] with 75,000 hp (300,000 in 25 man). These will add coruption to whoever they attack so they should be kited, preferably they should be killed/frozen/slowed on the spot and nuked down by DPS as fast as possible. How long phase one lasts increases the amount of Adherents spawned and therefore the amount of blood spawned, so this acts as the soft enrage to the fight.\n\n[b][u]Phase Two[/u] (25%-100%)[/b]\n[ul][li]In this phase Cho'gall becomes [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=94145] fully corrupted by the Old Gods[/url] and goes a bit mental. He fills the room a black AoE that increases corruption and deals damage every 2 seconds to everyone in the room. [/li]\n[li] He will also spawn four [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93162]Darkened Creations[/url] that are tentacles, 4 in 10 man (10 in 25 man). These should be killed ASAP as they channel [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93134] Debilitating Beam[/url] which reduces healing and damage done by 75% and do alot of damage.[/li]\n[li]Heroism and all other cooldowns should be saved until this phase as the longer it goes on the more damage you take and I'm sure the healers won't be happy about that[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nIt's actually a pretty boring fight during the first phase considering the wall of text I just wrote, the second phase however is quite fun :b.\n\n~[url=http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/grim-batol/taliwyr/advanced]Tali[/url] - Grim Batol EU - [url=http://www.dimensional-wow.com/]Dimensional[/url]", "date": "2011-01-02T16:16:09-06:00", "rating": 76, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Attention healbot users: Before the raid, open the Cure tab, click the [Custom] Button, select Cata - Raid from the drop-down menu, type \"Corruption: Accelerated\" in the text box, press [Save], and click [Yes] on the popup window.

In time, Cho'gall became one of the most feared and venerated members of the Old Horde during the First and Second Wars against the humans.\r\n\r\nCho'gall became the Chieftain of an orc clan after the previous one was executed for disobeying the Shadow Council. Cho'gall renamed the clan as the Twilight's Hammer, while all records of both the clan's old name and the chieftain's one were destroyed.[3]\r\n\r\nThough Cho'gall was extremely powerful, he was also dangerously insane. The clan, less of a tribe and more of a religious cult, was devoted to bringing about the apocalypse. In his capacity as a chieftain and as the right hand of Gul'dan, Cho'gall aided his master in the creation of the death knights and the Altars of Storms, and in the transformation of normal ogres into ogre magi.\r\n\r\nCho'gall and the Twilight's Hammer followed Gul'dan and the Stormreaver Clan when the warlock went to discover the Tomb of Sargeras. Though he did not enter the tomb himself, Cho'gall was assaulted while defending Gul'dan from the Black Tooth Grin led by Rend and Maim, the sons of Blackhand, who had been sent by Orgrim Doomhammer to destroy the traitor clans that had abandoned the war on the Alliance just before the final push on Capital City. While many perished on the Broken Isles, some members of the Twilight's Hammer clan were able to survive, including Cho'gall, who had long been presumed dead at the hands of the sons of Blackhand and their Black Tooth Grin clan.
