He was hesitant about joining, and was difficult about it, and less sincere when he agreed to it.However, he pulled Gilneas from the Alliance after the Second War. He was also deeply influenced by the House of Prestor, which was actually led (at the time) by Deathwing in human form.\nWhen Alterac's rulership was removed, he had his eye on that land there, even though he had no right to it. He supported Aiden Perenolde's nephew's claim to the throne. Lord Genn Greymane never supported the Lordaeron Alliance in the Second War. Thus, after the war, he constructed the Greymane Wall: a massive barrier spanning the entire northern border on the edge of Gilneas and Silverpine Forest. He joined the Alliance in the Second War, but offered only token support. Thus Gilneas had essentially remained separate from the Alliance of Lordaeron. As ruler of one of the strongest Human nations, Genn Greymane was convinced that his own armies could deal with any threat, and therefore remained unmoved by Lord Lothar\u2019s pleas for unity. Despite his apparent disdain for the Alliance, the denizens of Gilneas harbored no fondness for the Orcs or their allies and were prepared to meet them blade for blade.\nA small group of soldiers known as the Gilneas Brigade joined the Human Expedition led by Jaina Proudmoore during the Third War, but they likely were not sent by Genn Greymane as Gilneas was secluded from the rest of Lordaeron since the end of the Second War.\n\nGenn Greymane will make his debut in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. He is one of the first people Worgen players meet when he saves the player from a executioner's blade by injecting them with a serum that gives them control of themselves. Genn himself, has also been affected by the curse, yet he prefers to remain in his human form most of the time.\nAfter the fall of Gilneas, Genn can be found in Stormwind Keep, standing next to King Varian Wrynn.\n\n-Wowwiki", "date": "2010-08-11T18:22:10-05:00", "rating": 38, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Sadly his current model lacks the badassery he is due.
