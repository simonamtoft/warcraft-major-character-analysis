{"commentv2": 1, "number": 0, "id": 2092299, "nreplies": 2, "sticky": 0, "user": "Balix123", "body": "The birth of Garona was orchestrated by Gul'dan, who \"bred\" one of his orcish warriors to a draenei female (which in itself implies rape). The result conceived a child that, as it would be discovered later, looked surprisingly human. Gul'dan had her magically aged and tortured, later also placing controls on her mind to ensure obedience. Garona would be raised in barracks with her father's people, hated by the bigger orcs for being different. Their judgements of her being \"ugly and deformed\" would become her own for years to come. The draenei female's brother however, the Vindicator Maraad, would not care that Garona was half orc. Having learned that his sister had borne a child, he began to search for his niece that would stretch on for many years.\r\nHaving travelled throughout Draenor, Garona was well-versed in the culture of the orcs, making her an invaluable asset to the Shadow Council. She was inducted into the warlock-controlled Stormreaver clan. She quickly became the chief interpreter of the Shadow Council and Gul'dan's personal spy and assassin. However, Garona belonged to no clan, and had no clan allegiance. Due to her mixed blood, she was eternally an outcast and had to rely upon her wits to keep her alive in a harsh world. Upon arriving in Azeroth, Garona's experience lent a great deal to her insight with their newest foe \u2014 the humans.\r\nOriginally, she was a member of one of the first raiding parties into Azeroth, and also one of the few to confront the Guardian Medivh. While her party was wiped out, she was spared and sent back to relay a message to the warlock Gul'dan. After a period of time, she returned and met with the Magus on many occasions. Eventually, she was granted the title of Emissary and sent to Karazhan. It was there that she met Khadgar, Medivh's apprentice (and observer from Dalaran). Khadgar was, at first, furious at her presence, but the Magus demanded Khadgar treat her with respect. A trust was formed between the two when a bizarre demon appeared in the library of the great tower, and both had to utilize their skills together to defeat it. Garona and Khadgar continually criticized each other's race while defending their own. Eventually, Garona mentioned to Khadgar that the orcs had been arriving on Azeroth via a gateway known as the Dark Portal.\r\nGarona also began to respect Magus Medivh a great deal, and because of that respect, she started to debate her true loyalties. Stating that the \"Old Man\" had told her everything she wanted to know, despite knowing full well that she was a spy, she felt that she could never break that trust. She even made the comment that the bond of trust made her feel more 'human', and that she felt Medivh had a grand dream to bring something better to this world. It may have been around this time that Medivh fathered Garona's son, Med'an. \r\nSoon after, Garona became a trusted confidant to King Llane, but because of Medivh's mind games, she was unable to form a true allegiance. She reported to King Llane the inner workings of the Horde and how he could use it to his advantage. After her \"release\" by orc forces during a raid on Northshire Abbey, she was ordered (presumably by the Shadow Council) to kill King Llane. Realizing that her vision had become a reality, she reluctantly carried out this task, and with a deep sadness, murdered King Llane, cutting his heart out. At the time, she was pregnant with her son, Med'an.\r\nGul'dan was in coma by this time, so Orgrim Doomhammer used this situation to his advantage, killing the corrupt Blackhand and seizing the mantle of Warchief. His spies found Garona and tortured her, almost to death, until she finally revealed the secret location of the Shadow Council. The Council was destroyed, and most warlocks were slain. Spies of an unknown faction continued searching for Garona even after the Second War. She would avoid them all, and in time gave birth to Med'an. She sought out her friend, the ancient undead mage Meryl Felstorm, and citing her assassination of King Llane, she told Meryl that she was a danger to her child and entrusted the baby to him. Informing him of the baby's name, she asked that he never tell Med'an who his mother was. Bidding Meryl farewell, she dissappeared from the rest of the world, but would keep watch over her son from afar.\r\n\r\nCourtesy of Wowwiki", "date": "2015-01-21T10:43:42-06:00", "rating": 21, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wowwiki is dead.", "creationdate": "2016-10-22T06:48:17-05:00", "id": 999574, "rating": -1, "commentid": 2092299, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Mordecay", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "What is that comment disliked for?
