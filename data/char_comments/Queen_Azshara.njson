You will be fighting magi that are being controlled by the boss.  \r\n\r\nPeriodically throughout the fight the boss will cast total obedience which will mind control a player.  You need to interrupt the cast within 8 seconds.  So make sure to assign someone to interrupt.  The boss also randomly Mind Controls one player.  To interrupt the mind control you must kill the strings attached to the player called Hand of Azshara.  This along with interrupting her total obedience is your highest priority.\r\n\r\nThe 3 types of adds are Fire, Frost, and Arcane.  There are 6 adds and you'll have to fight 2 at a time.  They don't necessarily wait for the first 2 to die so if your slow at killing them you will start getting more.  \r\nBest strategy to follow is to just have everyone spread out minus your tank and melee dps and focus down 1 mage at a time.  the fire mage does a targetted aoe with a 6 yard radius and can hurt if too many people are bunched up.  the frost mage does a frost ability that fires infront of the mage in a line, just get out of it when it happens, he'll also randomly charge a player and hit anyone along the way (another reason to spread out).  The arcane magus does a group wide aoe called arcane shock, it does a large amount of damage and can be interrupted so make sure anyone not assigned to interrupt total obedience is watching for it.  This along with stuns will stop the aoe.   \r\n\r\nEdit:  Stuns do work on the mages and i recommend applying all stuns to the arcane mage.  [s]Not sure if there was a buff to this fight, but my last few times through this the arcane mage's arcane shock pretty much wiped my group if we didn't stun him when he started to spin.[/s]  So make sure the arcane mage dies first and if you have anyone that can stun have them stun him when he starts spinning.\r\n\r\nEdit2:  Just tried this fight again today to see if anything changed.  The arcane shock has been changed to allow [s]interrupts[/s] and unless i had an extremely good healer i believe the magus' damage was reduced.\r\n\r\nEdit3:  Now that 4.3 is on live servers the Arcane magus's arcane shock has been changed back to an uninterruptible spell.  However, stuns do still work and i'd recommend saving any stuns for him.  The damage from arcane shock is not nearly what it was at the beginning of PTR but not laughable like it was towards the end.  It does a fair amount of damage and the arcane magus is still your number one priority when dpsing down the adds.\r\n\r\nkill priority\r\nHand of Azshara > Arcane Magus > Frost Magus > Fire Magus.", "date": "2011-10-20T04:26:51-05:00", "rating": 77, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I wouldn't fight her even if the encounter requires it.
