In 10man, spread equally on all sides, 2 healers is doable, 3 is fine as well. I suggest either 1 tank/3 heal/6 dps or 2 tank/2heal/6 dps, 2tank/3heal/5dps really isnt needed. In 25, 2 tanks, 6-7 healers and rest dps.\n\nPhase 1 (100-80%)\n\nThe key here is to spread like CRAAAAAZY. In 10man, make single stacks and spread healers equally to be able to heal everyone. In 25, make stacks of 2's and 3's, the damage is pretty crazy compared to 10man but you just gotta heal it. Boss doesnt hit tank very hard at all.\n\nAs for abilities, he spawns a random lightning web thingie that chains to everyone inside it, hitting for 20k for every player inside. So make sure you move ONLY front/back and not sideways when moving (sometimes you have to, but just avoid it generally).\nWhen Wind Burst casts, move closer to boss, deals ~40k dmg to everyone and knocks them back.\nDont stand under blizzard (the blizzard itself doesnt hurt, but the ice on ground doe and slows).\nWhen tornados circle around the platform, find the gap between them and go through it to avoid getting grabbed by them. This is all about invidual skill, everyone must be aware of tornados coming from both sides.\n\nPhase 2 (80-25 (30?)%)\n\nChain lightning web of doom stops, so everyone move to one side of the boss, with tank on one end, melee dps on other and ranged in between.\nTornados from P1 still spawn, they also spawn faster so you might have 2 up at the same time. Wind burst is gone (Not 100% sure on this, cant remember atm), but little adds called stormlings spawn. Offtank or a dps with a taunt (DK in BloodP is <3) grab them and keep them away from the raid and bring them down one by one after 3 of them are spawned. On death, they will debuff boss with 10% damage taken, which stacks, so make sure you dont instantly kill the first one that spawns but wait a little bit.\nThere will also be a debuff called Acid Rain which stacks as long as phase 2 lasts, dealing increasing damage to everyone in the raid (the stacks can be reseted with AMS/bubble/block). Pop hero/bl somewhere around halfway through p2, its not really needed in p3.\n\nPhase 3 (till 0)\n\nEveryone flies in to the air, boss is untankable. This is really a lot easier than any of the phases, it just looks like it could be hard. Start by having EVERYONE move UP, towards the altitude of the bosses head. Set up some raid marks to keep everyone at the same level. When storm clouds spawn, move downwards a bit. When lightning appears around someone, move away from him. Rinse and repeat until boss is dead. If you get too close to the bottom, simply move through the lightning cloud, the damage isnt even that bad.\n\nMechanically the best fight in the first tier (par sinestra possibly), but phase 3 is a bit of a let down.", "date": "2010-12-21T20:25:58-06:00", "rating": 132, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "We killed it about week ago in 10m, the most important think in first phase are spacing between ppls.

Be careful not to pull. You cannot face pull.[/li]\r\n[li]Before the pull you will want to split your raid up into 5 groups (2 people on each of the Fleur de Lis looking areas on the platform) due to his ability [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93257]Lightning Strike[/url].  This ability looks like a blanket on the platform and comes outward from Al'Akir in a cone. It will chain to everyone in the area. Make sure each player in the raid can be reached by at least one healer.[/li]\r\n[li]In addition, Al will spawn two [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87856]Squall Lines[/url] which are columns of tornadoes rotating around the platform. One will be rotating clockwise, and the other will be counterclockwise. They are alternated on their spawn times and they will make one orbit around the platform before disappearing. The way to avoid this is by the one absent tornado in the line, ideally, by running through the opening. If you touch a tornado, you will be caught in the vortex for a few seconds, taking ~40k damage per second. The only way out of this is the Priest's ability [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=73325]Leap of Faith[/url].[/li]\r\n[li]Furthermore, Al'Akir will cast [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93260]Ice Storm[/url]... A blizzard mechanic that leaves an ice patch on the ground. Easily avoidable, so do so.[/li]\r\n[li]Finally, the last ability in P1 is [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87770]Wind Burst[/url]. This ability has a cast time, and to avoid being knocked off the platform, you must move in before the cast is complete. It knocks players back about 3/4 the platform. Be careful with tornado and wind burst timing... don't get wind burst into a tornado. Run through ice if you need to.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]---Phase 2: (80%-25%)[/b]\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]During the transition into this phase, have everyone converge to the middle and stack in a triangle. Ranged out, Tank and Melee in melee range about 20 yards apart.[/li]\r\n[li]The reason you want to stack in this phase is to alleviate pain on the healer's part due to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93281]Acid Rain[/url], which persists throughout the phase and places a stacking debuff on every raid member.[/li]\r\n[li]In addition, Al'Akir will spawn a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=47175]Stormling[/url] every 25 seconds or so. They need to be killed, and once killed they will apply [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87904]Feedback[/url] to Al'Akir which increases his damage taken by 10% and stacks indefinitely.[/li]\r\n[li]Squall Lines continue to spawn in P2.[/li]\r\n[li]Wind Burst is [b]NOT[/b] cast in P2.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[b]---Phase 3: (25%-0%)[/b]\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]During the transition into this phase, Al will shatter the platform and everyone will gain an [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=89107]Eye of the Storm[/url] buff which increases movement speed by 300% and allows everyone to fly.[/li]\r\n[li]At this time, you will want to have someone marked to stack on horizontally, like you would in the Malygos encounter. This is due to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93298]Lightning Clouds[/url], which is spawned at the altitude of a random player. After the cloud is cast, you have a few seconds to elevate before it erupts in lightning.[/li]\r\n[li]However, while stacked you need to be aware of the player with [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=89668]Lightning Rod[/url]. This is similar to a Shaman's Thunderstorm and will damage players within 20yards.[/li]\r\n[li]Additionally, he will begin to cast Wind Burst again. Move in to prevent being knocked back into the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=89104]Relentless Storm[/url]. This will trap you for 6 seconds and cause nature damage.[/li]\r\n[li]Burn him down and you will have your kill![/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[b][u]Tips:[/u][/b]\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Avoid tornadoes.[/li]\r\n[li]Time Stormling deaths for Feedback stacks.[/li]\r\n[li]Don't be bad.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\nI wish you the best of luck, and feel free to critique my post and ask any questions.\r\n\r\nPlease uprate if this helped at all!\r\n\r\nA link to our video on YouTube is [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s1q70iUicA]HERE[/url] so you can see how it's done.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 54, "id": 1683860, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Hairband", "body": "In 4.3.4, this boss is still hard but not because of your DPS.  It's hard because of mechanics.  You need one tank and someone with some tank abilities (DK was perfect with Death Grip) to pull the Stormlings in Phase 2.  Also, don't release or you will be locked out.  \r\n\r\nTry to focus on this strat (10 man run):\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Phase 1--Probably the Hardest Phase:[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is to avoid the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=91110]Squall Line[/url].  You need to call on Vent:  \"Clockwise front\", \"Clockwise middle\", \"Clockwise back\", or \"Counter front\", \"Counter middle\", Counter back\".  This is because two Squall lines are going to be moving around, in a circle, on Al'Akir's platform.  You DO get about 5 seconds lead time by way of a dusty graphic on the ground, to show you where the Squall Line will form so get the hell off of that spot.  Get used to moving into these holes, but trying to stay inside your wedge on the platform (i.e., don't go right or left but try to remain on your fleur de lis spread out), and your party can move pretty freely to find that hole, center yourself because you do get snagged sometimes, and safely stand in the hole of the Squall Line.  Squall line can kill you but if you are lucky enough to ONLY get a knock back, you lose 10 seconds of time, which just prolongs this annoying fight.\r\n\r\nSecondly, once that's under control, you have to hug him like your best pal when he does a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87770]Wind Burst[/url].  However, if you are trying to make a break for the Squall Line at the same time, just let yourself fall off.  If you have DBM and its sound on, you do get a nice warning sound for every Wind Burst.  I just called out \"Hug him\" for every Wind Burst---no one forgot what to do by the end of the fight.\r\n\r\nAs for the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93257]Lightning Strike[/url] conal web attack: it is not that bad.  Our healers had plenty of mana to heal through it--and yes, we did  really open up for this, 2-3 people on each Fleur de Lis shape, all doing a range check for the healers.  There is no reason to stack for this, the conal attack is 60 degrees.\r\n\r\nIf you just call out the Squall Line and listen and call out the Wind Burst, you can get the feel for this Phase and get through.  People were saying front, back, etc. but without the Clock or Counter, you sometimes would hit one before the other and get stuck.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Phase 2:[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\nYou still get the wonderful Squall Line and Wind Burst, just like in Phase 1, but you will notice Phase 2 rolls around when Al'Akir is 80% health and the first Stormling appears.  At that time, tank pulls around the back of the party and the party gets into a formation of melee in front and ranged in the back with healers able to reach both groups.\r\n\r\nTanks, if you are out of range due to a knockback from the Wind Burst, regain aggro ASAP or else someone will get your Electrocute.  It hurts bad and you want to have a healer in range of you---DPS should not taking it.  Inevitably, some DPS will take it but hopefully will get healed back up.  \r\n\r\nTank stays at opposite end of all DPS, ideally.  Melee DPS (not necessarily an OT but someone not squishy) will pick up [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=47175]Stormlings[/url].  Ranged, you don't want these on you; please AOE them down.  Each one down gives you a 20 second debuff to help you kill the boss called [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=87904]Feedback[/url].  The Stormlings are called about once every 20 seconds so you can keep these rolling.  Immediately after killing a Stormling, get back on the boss.  \r\n\r\nAfter maybe about 8 of these Stormlings die and you move defensively, just as you did in Phase 1, at around 25%, you will be done with Phase 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Phase 3:[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\nAt 25%, Al'Akir's platform crumbles.  You will note at his feet there are a weblike lighting structure--do not go there.  They will kill you.  You can fly around and get the feel for the movement, but basically you spread out at his feet (some say head, that's fine), and start the dps.  The three positions basically are feet, his belly button, and his head (also this is the ceiling of the Storm).  Get used to everyone moving, preferably to a marked raid leader, to the same vertical spot, though spread around, for this fight.  Feet, belly, head, belly, head, etc. are the positions you will take depending on where you need to move to.\r\n\r\nYou still get the Wind Bursts from Phases 1 & 2, which are now instant casts instead of having maybe 5 seconds cast lead time.  You get one party who has to run out due to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93294]Lightning Rod[/url].  They need to stay at the same vertical height, just back up aways until it passes and ready to move up if the party moves up.  \r\n\r\nThen, every 30 seconds or so, a zone of Al'Akir vertically will be deadly due to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93298]Lightning Clouds[/url].  This basically is the reason you move from feet, belly, head, belly, etc. to try to find a clear zone.  So you are going to be moving from the Lightning Clouds, hug him for the Wind Bursts, and if you get Lightning Rod, back up from the party.  The key to movement is everyone stay the same and follow the leader you designate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it!  Phase 1 is definitely the hardest, and once you get that, Phase 2 will be easy.  Then, Phase 3 is really weird and fast, and we wiped plenty of times at 4% boss health but we eventually did it with some new raiders who wanted to see the instance and were geared in Hour of Twilight or LFR.", "date": "2012-07-03T02:33:29-05:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

As long as you constantly use [spell=34477] to your pet when on [npc=45871]'s platform, you also shouldn't get any aggro, as I recommend speccing your pet ferocity instead of tenacity, the DPS is needed. Agility food([spell=104275]), [item=49633], and [item=79257] isn't a must but certainly helps. A core hound pre-cast [spell=90355] couldn't hurt either. [spell=56829] and [spell=20895] are required, and I also specced [spell=109306] for this fight, as when no one is on [npc=45872]'s platform, his debuff ([spell=85573]), makes you silenced, preventing you from using [spell=34026].\n\n[b]Strategy (Conclave of Wind): [/b]Start off by bursting down [npc=45870], due to the debuff from the other wind lords, your haste is decreased by 5000%, and you won't be able to use [spell=34026]. Use all your CDs, and try to kill him before you run out of focus. Once [npc=45870] is dead, (you should be 90% health or more) run over to [npc=45871]'s platform. Getting to his platform means you get your haste back, but you are still silenced. [npc=45871] has a very strange aggro table, I actually had to macro [spell=34477] into my attacks for him to not attack me. Get out of the [spell=86111]es ASAP, and stay behind him, as he uses a frontal AoE attack ([spell=86082]).Use [spell=90361] once [npc=45872]'s debuff starts doing a lot of damage. If you get low after that, you can use a [item=76097]. Use any CD's you have to finish [npc=45871], and once he's dead run over to [npc=45872]'s platform. Once you get there it's pretty much a kill, however when he casts [spell=84643], you can still take 300k fall damage, you can avoid this by using [spell=781] right before you hit the floor. All you have to do is kill [npc=45872] before [npc=45870] finishes casting [spell=86307], and it should be a kill.\n\n[b]Strategy ([npc=46753]): [/b]Just avoid Tornadoes ([spell=87856]) and stand close to him so his [spell=87770] don't knock you off, [npc=46753] is a ton easier than the conclave of wind, as long as your in 540+ you can pretty much just burn him. It should be noted though that killing [npc=47175] put a 10% increased damage debuff ([spell=87904]) on [npc=46753], and it does stack, so it is useful to either let them build up, then kill them all at once, or kill them one by one as they spawn.
