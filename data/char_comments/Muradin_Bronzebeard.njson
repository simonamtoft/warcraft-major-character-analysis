When you enter the entryway from outside, there is a table of books on your right and a doorway leading to another room with Jeff Miller <Guild Emissary> to your left.  The NPCs are always in that room with the table of books.\r\n\r\nQ: I cannot find the NPC I want..  Why not?\r\nA: They rotate randomly on a daily basis and only one is available in your town hall per day.   \r\n\r\nQ: What possible NPCs can spawn?\r\nA: You will get either (1) Muradin Bronzebeard - he will offer two quests.  One quest is to kill one of the raid bosses in WoD.  The other quest will be to kill one of the 5 man bosses in WoD.  (2) Harrison Jones will spawn.  He will offer one of 6 Treasure contract quests.  Completing all of the quests yields and achievement and Harrison Jones becomes a follower.  (3) Renzik \"The Shiv\" will spawn.  He offers bounty quests which leads into the Ring of Blood questline.  The Ring of Blood questline awards gold, apexis crystals and upgrade tokens for followers. Renzik can be skipped imo.  (4) Vendors.  Either Dorothy Two (fur trader), Jake the Fox (Beast Hide), Alexi Hackercam (ore trader), Samantha Scarlet (herb trader), or Enchantress ismae (dust trader) will spawn.  Each of these offer advanced recipes and patterns that cannot be obtained anywhere else for professions.  Best to check every day to see if one has spawned for you.\r\n\r\nQ: I want a specific trader to spawn but it never shows up!  I'm frustrated!  Is there another option?\r\nA: Yes.  Other players may have the trader you want.  Only 1 type of trader spawns per day for everyone.  Ask other players to check to see what trader has spawned for them.  Then you can visit their garrison and use their trader.", "date": "2017-01-29T14:13:53-06:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
