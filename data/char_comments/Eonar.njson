To start the fight talk to Eonar in the blue/black orb in the middle of the room.\n1. You have a new spell available in this fight called [url=https://www.wowhead.com/spell=245781/surge-of-life]Surge of Life[/url] which gives you the ability of jump in the air, have slow fall and then a new spell after use called [url=https://www.wowhead.com/spell=254497/dive-down]Dive Down[/url]. Use this spell to get on the platforms where the adds spawn quickly.\n2. The main goal of this fight to defend Eonar herself by not letting her health fall to 0%, if it does you will be insta killed by a spell called [url=https://www.wowhead.com/spell=246344/death-of-a-titan]Death of a Titan[/url]. When you kill adds a green bar next to Eonar bar will be filled, once it reaches 100 she will release a room wide damage against all enemies called [url=https://www.wowhead.com/spell=250467/life-force]Life Force[/url]. This spell will also hit \"[b]The Paraxis[u][/u][/b]\" which is the main \"Boss\" in this fight although you can't target it directly.\n3. Once you start the fight you'll want to jump on the top most platform, on the eastern side of the room, the first wave will always spawn there. Kill all adds and especially the [url=https://www.wowhead.com/npc=123760/fel-infused-destructor]Fel-Infused Destructor[/url] as he will deal massive damage to the boss and end the fight very quickly.\n4. When you kill all the adds on the first platform \"The Paraxis\" will teleport to a different platform on the room, try to get there as soon as possible and again kill every add possible.\n5. At some point some flyers will come in and fly all the way to Eonar, if you're ranged just kill them when you can, if melee they will fly down and be target-able down from the stairs of the top/eastern platform or just in front of Eonar herself.\n6. Keep doing that until 4 casts of [url=https://www.wowhead.com/npc=123760/fel-infused-destructor]Surge of Life[/url] that will kill \"The Paraxis\" and win the fight, your loot is waiting just in front of Eonar.\nThank you for reading, make sure to upvote if you enjoyed and correct any mistakes I might have made :)\n*Numbers might be different on other difficulties and future versions of the game*\nEdit 1: I only noticed this in a fight later, there are wavy lines in some points on the arena that can transport you around the area, mainly from high to low platforms and vice versa. Use them as they are very useful and fast.\nEdit 2: I managed to solo this on Heroic, it was a bit too near for comfort but still doable if you are fast on your feet. It was too close on Heroic so I wouldn't try on Mythic for me at least but in a patch or two it might be even easier with better gear.", "date": "2021-03-16T17:12:28-05:00", "rating": 10, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2021-03-27T08:38:31-05:00", 3, "Marvid385"]}
