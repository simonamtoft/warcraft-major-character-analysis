He could always turn the tide of battle. He could always find the enemy's weakness. When ogres attacked and his clan faced annihilation, he orchestrated a daring last-minute triumph alongside his second-in-command, Orgrim. On the eve of battle, the chieftain reclaimed a famous weapon, the Doomhammer, and restored hope for victory. The elements, chaotic forces of nature that had allowed him to survive the ordeal, encased his fist in dark, heavy stone. He took a name worthy of it: Blackhand\r\n\r\nAs all the chieftains, Blackhand was present during a Kosh'harg festival in Nagrand. Later on he went to a meeting to Oshu'gun, where Ner'zhul told them that draenei were their enemies. After this, Blackhand then started to attack draenei hunters.\r\n\r\nA Raider of the Sythegore Arm, and one of the most honored warriors in the Horde, Blackhand became the renowned chieftain of the powerful Blackrock clan on Draenor.Known as a tactical genius and a ruthless dictator who demanded respect from his warriors, his ego and lust for power made him very easy to manipulate \u2014 a fact which Gul'dan discovered very quickly. Through political manipulation and by stoking the embers of Blackhand's ego, Gul'dan was able to convince the Blackrock chieftain that he was a respected equal in the warlock's dark scheme, both the public leader of the Horde and a member of the secret Shadow Council; he was in fact merely a means to an end for the evil warlock. With popular support \u2014 no doubt manipulated by Gul'dan \u2014 Blackhand was elected Warchief of the newly-formed Orcish Horde, but kept in line with Gul'dan's objectives through subtle bribery and outright blackmail.\r\n\r\nBlackhand eagerly offered all of his shamans, cut off by the spirits for waging their demon-incited war against the draenei, to become the first Horde warlocks. In order to increase the number of warriors the Horde would be able to field against the draenei, Blackhand even had his own children's ages accelerated, making them battle-ready. He commanded Durotan to do the same with his frostwolves, but refused. So Blackhand gave him another task - to lead an attack on Telmor. After its fall, Blackhand's family moved to the town. He also enlisted the aid of ogres led by Krol. Commanding from the Hellfire Citadel, Blackhand directed the later campaigns against the draenei, including the invasion of Karabor. After its fall, the orcish clan gathered at the Throne of Kil'jaeden where everyone was sure he will be the first to drink the blood. Grom Hellscream stepped first. Blackhand also refused Griselda to drink the blood. After this, Shattrath City fell and Blackhand searched for the body of the Prophet Velen in the ruins, with no success\r\n\r\nLeading the Horde through the Dark Portal after defeating the draenei and after the first failed attack on Stormwind Keep, Blackhand conducted the entire war effort against the Kingdom of Stormwind in what became known as the First War. During the War, his daughter disobeyed him and fled to the Deadmines with Turok and his ogres. Blackhand learned about this and sent a group of warriors to kill Griselda and her new friends.\r\n\r\nSoon after Gul'dan fell into a coma after attempting to steal information pertaining to the Tomb of Sargeras from the mind of Medivh, Blackhand was left vulnerable. Seizing the opportunity provided by the powerful warlock's incapacitation, Blackhand's second-in-command, Orgrim Doomhammer \u2014 later known as the Backstabber for the deed he was about to commit \u2014 decided to seize power from the puppet Warchief, hoping he could lead his wayward people from the path they had taken. Leading loyalist troops in a surprise attack, Doomhammer defeated Blackhand and cut his head from his shoulders, becoming both Warchief and Chieftain of the Blackrock. Orgrim then led the Horde to the victory in the First War.\r\n\r\nINGAME video HC mode\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTJHbzbo1Rc", "date": "2015-02-07T05:07:20-06:00", "rating": 18, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y1r4GIzMPs Mage Pov", "creationdate": "2015-04-06T18:33:47-05:00", "id": 860932, "rating": 0, "commentid": 2100504, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Swemage", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Also, try to face your character outwards (i.e. your back is facing the centre) so that you don't fly outwards.\n*Extra note for tanks: For phases 1 and 2, do take care not to be smashed at the same time. To prevent this, the offtank can stay behind Blackhand. For phase 3, offtank should taunt after main tank gets Massive Smash as it leaves a DoT.\n\n2) Phase 2 Smash should be positioned so that melee DPS can fly up to balconies to kill adds. Of course, if tanks are confident enough, 1 tank can be sent upstairs as well. In that case, be sure to jump back down before another Smash happens.\nAlso, players fixated by Siegemakers should kite them into Slag Bombs (better them than other raid members) to remove armour. Other raid members should avoid stepping on them (especially for this phase as extra vulnerability on Siegemakers are helpful).\n\n3) During Phase 3, players with mines should run as close to the edge of the platform as possible to drop their mines.

While most guides will tell you that Shattering Smash's knockback is in relation to the position of the center of the circle, they don't tell you how the tank gets knocked back. The tank is [b]not[/b] knocked back in relation to Blackhand. [b]They will be knocked back in relation to where their back is facing.[/b]\r\n\r\nWhat that means is that, if you point your back towards Blackhand (normally a big no-no), you'd be sent flying right through him instead.\r\n\r\nThis is true for all phases of Blackhand, and on all difficulties as far as I know. So, you might be wondering, how does that relate to fighting this boss? Well, we came up with an alternate strategy in Phase 3 to reduce the risk associated with spears. Rather than facing the boss inward, with all the applicable raid members stacking behind the tank, you will be facing the boss on the outside of the ring, with raid members between the tank and Blackhand. When Massive Shattering Smash comes through, the tank needs to quickly turn their back to the boss so they don't get knocked off the platform.\r\n\r\nThe biggest benefit of this approach is that spears have much less chance for overlap into the smash soaking group.

Blackhand himself stormed the Dark Iron Dwarf city in what is now Blackrock Spire and created his capital of Hordemar.

Blackhand saw Draka hardly able to lift a bucket of water, and he took it as a sign of weakness on the part of the Frostwolf Clan. He told that if such a frail child had been born in Blackrock Clan they would have killed her. Because of this, Garad exiled Kelkar, Zuura, and Draka to the outskirts of the village.\n\nBlackhand, a brutal tyrant, was the first Warchief of the Horde until the end of the First War.\n\n[b]Rise of the Horde:[/b]\nAs all the chieftains, Blackhand was present during a Kosh'harg festival in Nagrand. Later on he went to a meeting to Oshu'gun, where Ner'zhul told them that draenei are their enemies. After this, Blackhand then started to attack draenei hunters.\nA Raider of the Sythegore Arm, and one of the most respected warriors in the Horde, Blackhand became the renowned chieftain of the powerful Blackrock clan on Draenor. Known as a tactical genius and a ruthless dictator who demanded respect from his warriors, his ego and lust for power made him very easy to manipulate \u2014 a fact which Gul'dan discovered very quickly. Through political manipulation and by stoking the embers of Blackhand's ego, Gul'dan was able to convince the Blackrock chieftain that he was a respected equal in the warlock's dark scheme, both the public leader of the Horde and a member of the secret Shadow Council; he was in fact merely a means to an end for the evil warlock.\nBlackhand eagerly offered all of his shamans, cut off by the spirits for waging their demon-incited war against the draenei, to become the first Horde warlocks. In order to increase the number of warriors the Horde would be able to field against the draenei, Blackhand even had his own children's ages accelerated, making them battle-ready. With popular support \u2014 no doubt manipulated by Gul'dan \u2014 Blackhand was elected Warchief of the newly-formed Horde, but kept in line with Gul'dan's objectives through subtle bribery and outright blackmail. Commanding from the Hellfire Citadel, Blackhand directed the later campaigns against the draenei, including the invasion of Shattrath City.\n\n\n[b]The Last Guardian[/b]\nLeading the Horde through the Dark Portal after defeating the draenei, Blackhand conducted the entire war effort against the Kingdom of Stormwind in what became known as the First War. Though Stormwind eventually fell, Blackhand was left vulnerable when Gul'dan fell into a coma after attempting to steal information pertaining to the Tomb of Sargeras from the mind of Medivh. Seizing the opportunity provided by the powerful warlock's incapacitation, Blackhand's second-in-command, Orgrim Doomhammer \u2014 later known as the Backstabber for the deed he was about to commit \u2014 decided to seize power from the puppet Warchief, hoping he could lead his wayward people from the path they had taken. Leading loyalist troops in a surprise attack, Doomhammer defeated Blackhand and cut his head from his shoulders, becoming both Warchief and Chieftain of the Blackrock.", "date": "2014-09-06T02:58:37-05:00", "rating": 20, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2014-09-06T02:59:53-05:00", 1, "Bulo"]}
