Here's what he does on 25man heroic:\r\n\r\n-Nerubian Burrowers are now summoned FOUR at a time. (On our first attempt, we stupidly tried having one tank on all four of the burrowers.

After only about 5 seconds of chasing someone, he'll already be moving faster than running speed. If you're not close to an ice patch when he targets you, you're as good as dead.\r\n\r\n-The scarabs in phase 2 have greatly increased health, and move much faster.\r\n\r\n-As in 10man heroic, you have only a limited amount of frost spheres for the entire fight.\r\n\r\n-And finally, his leeching swarm ability in phase 3 now leeches 30% of current health every second, instead of 10%.

If you have a DK tank have them on the boss and put two pally/warrior tanks on adds. These adds currently favor tanks with shields so DKs take too much damage for the healers to reasonably deal with.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure someone is using sunder armor/expose armor if you have a rogue or warrior (DPS or tank). Yes, you personally might lose some DPS but the gain in raid DPS will more than make up for it. \r\n\r\nWhat worked for us was having one group of ranged DPS on adds during phase one and having all melee and some ranged on the boss. This allowed us to adjust DPS on the boss depending on how fast he went down but also kept the adds from getting out of control. Your tanks CAN handle two adds at a time (provided they aren't too close to the boss) but if you wait for phase two to do any damage to them it becomes much more hectic.\r\n\r\nAlso for low DPS groups although the note above says to save all cooldowns for phase 3 I actually don't recommend this. If you are slow on bringing him down popping heroism and all DPS cooldowns after he pops up for the last time (say 32-36%) will allow you the extra DPS boost to keep him from burrowing and hitting the enrage timer (10 mins on 25-man)\r\n\r\nAlso on phase 3 there is to be NO aoe healing.

Block Value is harder to boost though - a tank's block set should typically be around 2000 BV.\n\nHowever, to get either of those stats up, most tanks end up using underpowered gear and sacrificing a ton of their other core stats like Armor, Dodge, Parry, AND several thousand stamina - for example, when I put on my block set I typically lose around 7000 health.\n\nThis is what makes it a suck stat for boss fights: if a raid boss like Vezax hits you for 20,000 and you block 2,000, that's 18,000 damage.  How many hits you can survive in a row without a heal is a good metric for tanks.  Do you want a low health pool and eat 60%+ of those hits, blocked or not, or do you want a high health pool and eat only 40%-45% ?  *DING* *DING*\n\nHowever, Anub'arak's adds don't melee for a ton straight up - it goes through a formula.  At the base, they melee for around 3000, but their Expose Weakness increases that damage by quite a bit. Expose Weakness stacks up to 9 times on the tank, and increases damage by 25% per application.\n\n[b]The trick here is the math.  Block Value is applied to the melee hit before it's increased by Expose Weakness.  The formula looks like this:[/b]\n\n(Damage - Block Value) * (100% + 25% * Expose Weakness stacks)\n- where 100% represents the value of the original hit\n- 25% is the amount that the hit is increased by\n\nLet's assume the tank has a Block Value of 2200.\n\nFollowing the formula, an unblocked hit on a tank with 9 Expose Weakness stacks looks like this:\n(3000) * (100% + 25% * 9)\n= (3000) * (100% + 225%)\n= 3000 * 325%\n= 10,500 per hit.\n\nTypical raid tanks will avoid maybe 50%-60% of those hits, but the rest of those hits are going through at full power.  With 2 to 4 hasted adds, that tank is going down sooner than later and won't be healable, especially thanks to the haste effect of Spider Frenzy the adds give to each other.\n\nHonestly, you COULD just send in any old tank, but the healing gets out of control.  You'd have to stack 2 healers on each tank who wouldn't be able to take a rest to heal ANYONE else.  You've already got 2 full-time healers on Anub'arak who hits fast and hard enough as it is... now you've got 2 healers dedicated to the Add tank just plain spam-healing.  That's 4 healers that can't help the raid in Phase 3 - good luck with the DPS requirements and raid heals THERE.\n\nNow if the tank is at 102.4% unhittable assuring them of a complete miss or a block, the math for a block looks like this:\n(3000 - 2200) * (100% + 25% * 9)\n= (800) * (100% + 225%)\n= 800 * 325%\n= 2,600 per hit.\n\nTHAT can be healed.\n\nWarrior tanks excel as Add tanks here thanks to Critical Block, which gives them a 60% chance to block DOUBLE the damage.  In their case then, they have a chance of STILL taking no damage even when they block a hit!  Imagine tanking 4 adds like that.  ...Yeah.\n\nPaladin tanks aren't bad Add tanks either.  Their only difficulty may be keeping the adds stunned/interrupted - pallies could stand to get a Glyph of Holy Wrath to slice their stun cooldown by half.\n\nKeep the adds from Shadow Striking and take them down quickly, and you're home-free.

One each at the beginning about 15 yards apart with Anub tanked between them. Offtanks pick one spot each to tank their respective adds on to keep them from burrowing. It's important the patches are not to far apart, allowing as much AoE as possible to hit the boss AND both groups of adds. \n\nOne of the DK's run back and pull down a patch before he burrows, the other pulls down one north, away from the two used for tanking adds.\n\n-When he burrows, the first person pursued rund south and stand next to the patch. A paladin follows him and uses HoP right before the spikes reaches him. When there are two seconds (three if your lag is dodgy) left on the HoP, run onto the patch. This maximises time between pursue targets and keeps your raid from using up your orbs too early.\n\nThe 2nd person to get pursued will move next to the northern patch (hopefully not using one of the two used for add-tanking) and repeat the process. Once the 3rd pursue starts, and if you have done it correctly, the person should run south and Anub should resurface in good time before the person is in danger of dying from the spikes.\n\nNote that it's important that both DK's and paladins are on the ball with their assignments for this to work. A proper HoF rotation is required. And of course the people being purusued have to make sure not to waste their HoF or enter too late and get killed.\n\nRinse and repeat this process for the first two burrowing phases. If you reach a 3rd burrowing phase, you are screwed as there are no more patches available. \n\nThe Spheres have 9000 hp and should be easily killed by the DK's before they fly back up.

You finish 2 Burrowers and focus on killing http://ptr.wowhead.com/?npc=34605 range ppl preferably. Don't cc them or snare since they will go frenzy and bite anyone in close proximity. Bite is nasty and on heroic it ticks for 1500 per 3 sec hole minute which means you have it trough phase 3. If you have 4+ debuffs and you get penetrating cold in phase 3, 99.99% you are dead (if not you someone else is). While he is underground do what ever to prolong his traveling and be sure to stand close to ice if he chase you go around ice not on ice since 80% can get you killed if he get to you fast.When he emerge from phase 2 u should be having 1-2 ice's ( one is enough) ,tank him on ice just in case dps fails and again 2 Burrowers need to be tanked-aoe like first 2. Make sure you kill them before 30%. \n\nOk phase 3. Leeching swarm hits and hole raid drops in hp rapidly. Top tank and off tank and watch if anyone have Penetrating cold (ticks around 6k).Person with PC need to be topped also (usually 2 persons have debuff so make sure you heal both equally). After few seconds another pair of burrowers spawn but this time you don't tank them on ice. Since Anub on phase 3 will not go under you can dps them all on ground without ice because burrowers will submerge around 70-75% hp giving you one less target to heal which is crucial for this fight. Less healing faster kill. If you are planing to drink health pot or health stone don't do it on 5-6k hp since you will loose it in few sec. Use it on 1-2 k it will benefit longer. Assuming your raid will have a shaman because of heroism pop it on exactly 30% ( if you see anub will go under before you reach 30 pop it little sooner, while having a shaman u can drop healing stream totem which can heal enough party on 1-2k hp level. Lowest possible heals on raid that doesn't take any dmg beside leeching swarm.Myself as a resto shaman use lower rank of LHW to raise there hp a little since healing them 7-10K heal boss to much and anyway person will loose that heal in few sec ( more hp you have more you loose).

Quick shields, flash heals, and renews are amazing for quick responses to Penetrating Cold (this is what was getting us on earlier attempts - druid heals weren't quick enough to catch two simultaneous Penetrating Cold applications since the entire raid is kept at approximately 10-15% health).  Prayer of Healing should be used, if players with the DoT are safe, in order to heal, apply Divine Aegis, and proc Inspiration on the groups.\r\n\r\nThis reversal of \"traditional\" healing roles seems counterintuitive, but it's incredible for this particular fight.  Regardless, in any fight where there's quick damage to respond to, a disc priest works wonders.  It's the bomb for Penetrating Cold and Locust Swarm damage in phase three.\r\n\r\nAdditional tips that make the fight easier:\r\n\r\n(1) It's already been mentioned, but have the off-tank either be a paladin or warrior to gain the benefits of block mechanics.  This makes a DRAMATIC difference in terms of incoming damage on the off-tank.  We initially tanked the adds with a deathknight and it didn't work nearly as well.\r\n(2) Intentionally let the adds burrow in phase three to relieve some healing stress on the off-tank.", "date": "2009-12-05T18:03:01-06:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-12-05T21:16:23-06:00", 1, "Akumas"]}

Keep him faced away; this is because of his pound ability (mentioned in other posts). Run through him when he starts to cast; he'll turn around but the attack won't. Run back through him as soon as you reach his tail, so he's facing the same way as before.\r\n - His insect swarm ability is nature damage. Even with 75NR from a druid buff, you'll resist much of the damage. A small amount of NR here can go a long way. If your group is weak, you may consider having everyone drink a Nature Protection potion before combat starts (this will help with the next phase, as well).\r\n - When he burrows, move to the ramp. You should be concerned with the elites that will come running down. Grab them.\r\n - While tanking these elites, it's probably best to kite them around while moving backwards near the ramp. This is so neither you nor your party get fixated on fighting and have the boss spike you from below. The boss seems to start the spike animation (the rumbling rocks) below someone's current position, rather than randomly, so moving helps.\r\n - Make sure your DPS knows to get the non-elite bugs. These fly in and tend to go straight for the healer.\r\n - Make sure your healer knows to move to avoid the spikes, and has the smarts to move to the tank should they get little bug aggro.\r\n - Two elites spawn the first time, then when you kill them, the boss reappears. Be ready to pick him up quickly. On subsequent waves, you get more elites (just two at first, but more come).\r\n - The boss's melee attack is only about 2500 on plate. The elites hit harder.

As I see it, there are four major flaws with the way he was implemented:\r\n\r\n[b]1)[/b] Making him a 5-man boss, when most of his contemporaries (and even his inferiors) were made into 25-man bosses. \r\n\r\nLorewise, Anub'arak was chosen by Ner'zhul to escort the weakened Arthas to Icecrown - a mission that the Lich King's continued existence depended on.  Along the way, Anub'arak helped to defeat the likes of Sapphiron, the Forgotten One, Vashj, Kael'thas, and Illidan.\r\n\r\nMechanically, Anub'arak was the ideal hero for taking on large groups of enemies by himself. He had nearly as much health as Cairne and twice as much armor, giving him unparalled survivability.  His spiked carapace returned damage to melee attackers (preventing him from being swarmed), his impale acted as an AoE stun, and his locust swarm allowed him to drain life from everyone around him.  Even when vastly outnumbered, he was nearly impossible to take down until he ran out of mana.\r\n\r\n[b]2)[/b] The overal feel of the fight. The number of players aside, a boss that can be burned down in under two minutes - even when he spends half the fight hiding underground - does not capture the \"unrelenting juggernaut\" feel of the [i]Warcraft III[/i] Anub'arak.  \r\n\r\nThis character stood out for being hard to kill - if Arthas died during the campaign, and had to be revived and sent back to the battle, it was not uncommon for Anub'arak to still be holding the line when he got there.  A battle against Anub'arak should be a war of attrition, not a race.\r\n\r\n[b]3)[/b] His voice. In [i]The Frozen Throne[/i], Anub'arak spoke with a very deep, rumbling voice.

We wiped about 10 times on him, only during the adds.  Sometimes during the 2nd wave and sometimes during the 3rd.  The healer couldn't stop taking aggro b/c he's a pally healer and his burst heals cause a lot more aggro.  I'm a pally tank as well, so I'd put down my consecrate and keep moving to avoid the spikes.  The things that killed us every time were the Veromancers due to their aoe poison spit.  So I would collect all adds until these 2 things came.  Once they came, I would use Turn Evil to fear the first one and then put a skull on the 2nd and kill him as fast as possible.  About that time, the other's fear would be done and I'd go find him.  We also had a DK OT to protect the healer b/c I couldn't seem to soak up all of them with my consecrate.  \r\n\r\nDuring one of our waves, the one we were successful on, there were 3 of us left on the 3rd wave of adds.  I kept fearing the last spitter until the rest of the mobs were done.  Magically, while the spitter was feared, the adds stopped coming.  So me, the healer, and the boomkin recharged while I kept this last spitter feared.  The boomkin was able to rez both the other 2 members and as long as we kept moving (to get away from the spikes in the ground), we rechaged to full health/mana.  After that, cake (no more waves of adds).  You can strategize to do this after the 2nd and 3rd wave if you want, mark one of the spitters to be feared and then burn everything else down.

I feel confident that if you follow these steps it should prove to be an easy boss-fight.\r\n\r\nThe facts are that the hardest things about this boss are:\r\n1.

[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59433]Pound[/url]\r\n\r\nAnub'ar Venomancers are the hardest things to deal with. There are several waves of adds that will be coming at you when Anub'arak burrows underground. The first wave is easy enough- two or three melee dps elites and about 8 reg dps mobs. The second wave will start off the same way with the Venomancers coming in jsut as you have the others at about half HP. YOU MUST DOWN those Venomancers quickly. They do tons of damage with their poison spit. However, their attacks ARE interrupt-able. Be that as it may- take those down first and foremost. The third wave will be the same as the second- perhaps a little easier. Just be wary.\r\n\r\nImpale is also completely avoidable. watch the ground when the boss go under and you'll notice rocks being dug up just like the worms in HH. Move away from the areas where the rocks are coming up and you won't be hit. \r\n\r\nPound is completely avoidable. Simply tank the boss so that he faces away from the group and run behind him by running through him.\r\n\r\nI suggest using a portal to get out, it's just annoying to get back out the normal way. \r\n\r\nGood Luck- I hope this was helpful!\r\n\r\n\r\nPS - Thanks to all of you who posted before me!

Tank should step forward through the boss a bit to avoid the pound. Having the target's cast bar viewable in the interface helps tremendously. \r\n2. Tank should pick up non-elite adds of convenience (those within consecrate/death-decay/holy wrath etc.) and dps players should handle the others. \r\n3. During down phases 2 and 3, venomancers must get kill priority, even if the two warriors are still alive, as they are not a real threat. \r\n4. The most dangerous part of the fight is the poison debuff. You get two of them and the group is toast. Poison cleansing totems, manual cleansing (self and others) and nature resist abilities are all mandatory. \r\n\r\nBurrowed phase strategies based on group makeup: \r\n\r\nA. If you have elite DPS and classes that can stun/interrupt: \r\n\r\nNo cc is necessary. Just stun the the living crap out of the venomancers until they're dead. Tank should drop aoe at the base of the ramp, catch everything coming down, and keep the current kill marked. If both venomancers are hanging around and dying at the same rate, you are doing it the hard way, and probably the dead way. As soon as the first venomancer comes down that ramp, it gets kill priority. Then the second venomancer. Then whatever's left. \"Elite DPS\" probably means the two warrior spiders are dead by the time the first venomancers arrive. If that's not you, go to plan B. \r\n\r\nAs a pally tank, I've got an AoE stun with my Holy Wrath and also my Hammer of Justice. So that's three stuns right there. Rogues can kick. Warriors do whatever they do (charge/sheild slam). Mages counterspell, etc. Chances are, whatever group you've got, you've got some stun ability that will suffice. \r\n\r\n\r\nB. If your DPS is sub-par you will need CC. \r\n\r\nMy strategy for CC is to grab aggro on the first two mobs (the warrior spiders) down the ramp and then drag them to the middle of the ring. As the third mob is coming (the first venomancer), target it and mark it for CC. \r\n\r\nThe best CC option is priest shackle. Lasts forever and can be redone. If you've got a ret pally but no priest, turn evil would work in a pinch. Lasts 30 seconds on undead. A pally tank can't really do it while being hit by the warriors spiders and a pally healer probably can't spare the long cast time while trying to heal the tank. A hunter frost trap could potentially work, but is risky if the mob resists. Then nobody knows what to do because the plan is screwed. \r\n\r\nAs the first venomancer is cc'd and the second one is coming down the ramp, target and mark it for killing. It will come down right where the first is shackled and will be hard to target if not marked properly. Your members should know how to tab target to avoid hitting the shackled guy. \r\n\r\nStun that second venomancer into next week until he's dead. Then you've got the option of killing the warriors (which may already be dead) or moving right on to the cc'd mob. With a pally fear, you probably want to kill the venomancer. With a shackle, go ahead and get the warriors out of the way, then kill the shackled mob.
