Aman'Thul granted Nozdormu two things - a portion of Aman'thul's own power, and knowledge of Nozdormu's own death.  An initially [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism]stoic[/url] Nozdormu may have accepted that, but over the aons his power over the flow of time may have tempted and corrupted him into trying to alter the flow of time to avoid his own death and make himself immortal.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is, success would carry with it the curse that he no longer knows his own death, making it much more difficult to predict and avoid, but his own death may still be out in the future waiting to claim him.  Hence he would need to not only find ways to predict and avoid that, but also to resurrect himself if that fails.  \r\n\r\nHence the creation of the Infinite Dragonflight - previous Bronze dragons loyal to him and willing and able reverse and reroute the flow of time to resurrect Nozdormu in the event of his death.  This would also require eliminating any of the Bronze Dragonflight - the only other time-altering-capable race - who choose not to join the Infinite Dragonflight, who might oppose and block the Infinite's efforts to use time to resurrect Nozdormu.  Which is where we seem to find the situation now in WotLK.\r\n\r\nOf course, the cost of such tampering would inevitably include as unintended consequences the creation of big problems for the races of Azeroth - anything from the merging of the Emerald Dream with reality to the resurrection of Archimonde and other past baddies.  It could also have some beneficial effect, such as the reversion of Deathwing to the [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing]good Neltharion[/url] and enlistment of his Twighlight Dragonflight in the battle against the Infinites.  All sorts of possibilities.  So the races of Azeroth must once again band together to not only help the Bronze Dragonflight defeat the Inifinite and Nozdormu, but also to deal with the all the problems caused by Nozdormu and the Infinites' time tampering. \r\n\r\nIf Bliz were to go this route, it would open the door for all sorts of new raids and abilities that use time as a key mechanic.  [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=569710]Prince of Persia, Sands of Time[/url], and many other games have done this to very creative effect, and it would be really cool to see Bliz's (almost undoubtedly amazing) implementation of it.  \r\n\r\nImagine the next hero class being of the Bronze Dragon race.  Flight From = Bronze Dragon, caster form = high-elf, can instantly shift like Druids.  Primary abilities focus on altering time - slowing, stopping, reversing, fast-forwarding, both for allies and enemies, local (a spot on the ground) and universal (everyone in 50yds).  This could be used raids in order to redo sections where a mistake was made, or the mt died, or something even more complex (since the Infinites we're raiding can also use time to do the same things).  It could be a healing-only class but with the powerful time-flow altering ability, and that would pretty much solve any healer shortage the way DKs solved tank shortages.", "date": "2009-07-27T17:03:44-05:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-07-27T17:40:42-05:00", 16, "Kurtosis"]}

What if everything the Infinite Dragonflight has done is meant to prevent Neltharion from being corrupted in the first place? I mean think about it. Lorewise Nozdormu, Malygos and Neltharion (before his corruption) were very close and trusting of each other. Thus, when Malygos died (by our hands) Nozdormu took it even harder than Alexstrasza did. From Malygos' point of view, magic was responsible for corrupting Neltharion in the first place, which explains why he drove himself so hard to remove magic from the hands of the mortal races. Which brings me back to my point. It very well could be that Nozdormu IS leading the Infinites and despite causing other paradox elsewhere in time, his ultimate goal is to prevent Neltharion's corruption and, in turn, Malygos' death. This would allow all 5 dragonflights to unite against the reason the Dragon Soul was created: to combat the Burning Legion.
