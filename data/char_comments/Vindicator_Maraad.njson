Click on the drop-down menu on the item group's control bar and hit View in 3D on Male Draenei if you don't believe me.  \n\nNotes on item selection: \n[small]1. FEET: The boots that best fit the color scheme of the Justicar gear don't have the symbol which can be seen on Maraad's boots.  There is another pair of boots which does have the symbol, and actually follows a closer color scheme to Maraad's (which has the same model as Justicar, but not exactly the same colors), so I can't decide which looks better in trying to recreate Maraad.  You can easily trade one pair of boots for the other in my item comparison by simply dragging and dropping - then view in 3D again to see the difference.  \n2. HEAD: Maraad is not shown to be wearing the headpiece, but I included one because it's part of the set.  What appears on his forehead instead is the visual effect of the Draenei Racial called [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=28880#.]Gift of the Naaru[/url].
