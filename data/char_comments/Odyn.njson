The other mechanics the bosses have do barely any damage.\n\nWhen they are both down, do slow DPS to Odyn.

You should ask him if he has considered Loken's final words to him. Go ahead![/quote]\n\nThis opens up a conversation option with Odyn where you ask him about Loken's final words.\n\n[quote]Odyn yells: How would... You dare mock my imprisionment? Then receive Loken's punishment in his stead![/quote]\n\nThen Odyn stomps on you and you die.\n\n[url=https://i.imgur.com/T6eyV4p.jpg]Screenshot[/url]\n\nFor those interested: Loken's final words \"My death... heralds the end of this world.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThe grammar is a bit odd here.

He will put giant swirls on the ground under ranged players and then drop a giant spear on them. The sword will periodically shoot out orbs that will stun anyone they hit, so tank the boss away from the spear. \r\n\r\n2. Odyn will cast Shatter Spears,  blowing up all spears and sending out a lot of those stun orbs. \r\n\r\n3. Odyn will grip all players to him and create a giant circle. Anyone who does not run out before he finishes his cast will take millions of damage. \r\n\r\n4. He will spawn an add that will cast Surge, an interruptible cast that does a lot of damage. Interrupt and burn the add down fast. \r\n\r\n5. He will put shapes above everyone's heads. You must run to the   corresponding rune on the ground before the debuff expires. Doing so will turn you into a val'kir and give you a 50% damage boost.
