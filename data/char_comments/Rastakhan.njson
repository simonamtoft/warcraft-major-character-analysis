While Rastakhan's lines are the same in both versions, Greymane's lines are different.\r\n\r\nIn the Alliance version, Greymane asks Rastakhan to step down or die, plain and simple. In the Horde version, he demands that Rastakhan surrender, and that both him and Talanji will be coming with them as their hostages. In both cases, Rastakhan refuses and claims he will fight to the death. While Genn can be quite bloodthirsty when it comes to the Horde, the  Alliance's mission was simply to kill the king and then retreat, so the Alliance version is likely canon.", "date": "2019-02-17T13:29:24-06:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Alliance version is also shown as it happens, while the Horde version is being relayed by someone else.
