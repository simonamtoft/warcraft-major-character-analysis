He did indeed (as we already know) survive the battle at the Wrathgate. Being tortured by Arthas, Bolvar still refused to become his servant and champion.\n\nAfter the death of Arthas Menethil, Tirion was ready to take his place as the new Lich King in order to keep the Scourge at bay. However, just before he put on the Lich King's crown, a familiar voice shouted out to him.\n\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon, engulfed in fires still burning from the purification of Alexstraza's red flame that was used to cleanse the Wrathgate, called out to Tirion. He convinced him to put the helmet of the Lich King on his head instead. Bolvar also told Tirion that none must know what truly went down in Icecrown Citadel that day, as if people were to realize that a Lich King was still alive, they could not avoid to live in fear and panic for the rest of their lives.\n\nRefusing at first, Tirion finally did what Bolvar asked him to. The eyes of the Lich King opened up once again, covering Bolvar's. The soul of one of the mightiest beings ever seen on Azeroth had corrupted a man who was pure at heart and true to all he believed in. Bolvar sealed himself as the Lich King in a block of ice and told Tirion to leave and never come back. This was the only way that Bolvar could aid the world now. He would forever keep the Scourge away from Azeroth.\n\nThe man who did something so great for the world he loves would be forgotten to cover up the existence of the Lich King. The man who boldly put the cursed crown on his head would do so without anyone knowing. And by the years he would always protect his beloved world in silence.\nThough no one would ever come to realize it, know that the end of the Scourge didn't come without a price. The world would've been destroyed if it wasn't for him.\n\nEven though his existence was meant to fade, always remember Highlord Bolvar Fordragon.

Considering how now, Bolvar Fordragon has now been given (or rather, requested, had) the Helm placed upon him, a similar transformation has undergone also. The Helm for starters (from what was shown) appears to be a more darker colour slightly, as well as the actual Gem housed within the centre of the Helm, turning from the Blue, to an Orange colour - along with the aura of flames (which were Blue, previous) coming from Bolvar's eyes now (which are also Orange).\n\n- - -\n\nIt also seems as if Bolvar is self-aware now, upon becoming the new Lich King as well (were as with Arthas, it seemed as if Ner'zhul was the one in control - as many simply assumed Arthas was no more - replaced by Ner'zhul - The Lich King, however the Frostmourne had a part to play on this act).

They will still exist and will be manipulated (for good or evil) by Bolvar.\n\n[quote]Is it possible that Bovar might be controlled by the spirit of Naz, Just like Arthas?[/quote]\nThis depends on whether Ner'zhul is alive (or, well, sentient.) There are contradictory sources on this. \n[ul]\n[li]In-game, we have the Tirion quest where you help destroy Arthas' heart, which Tirion can only allow himself to do after he's satisfied that Arthas is beyond redemption and no longer human.[/li]\n[li]We also have a Metzen quote - '\"Arthas and Ner'zhul have become a perfect fusion of one being - Arthas' personality and body with Ner'zhul's wisdom, experience, power and EVIL.\" Note however that I am unable to find a proper citation for this and the Wowwiki page I took it from does not have a citation either.[/li]\n[li]We have a blue post by Bornakk - 'Before Arthas donned the Lich King's armor, it was the spirit of the former Orc Shaman Ner'zhul whose soul was attached to the armor and then imprisoned (physically) inside the Frozen Throne. Now Arthas and Ner'zhul's spirit are one and together they are the Lich King.' However, the thread this was originally posted in is now AWOL and as such there is again no citation beyond Wowwiki.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nOn the other hand, we have -\n[ul]\n[li]Golden's Arthas novel, which had Arthas slaughter the avatar of his humanity but then tell Ner'zhul that he didn't need him either and murder his avatar as well, after which Ner'zhul dissipated.[/li]\n[li]The fact that the cinematic for Arthas' deathscene has the Lich King glow fade from Arthas' eyes and he looks basically human again before he dies. Surely if Ner'zhul was still in there the glow would never fade?[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nWe know Arthas is dead. We don't know if Ner'zhul is dead - he didn't appear to die with Arthas, meaning the only thing which could have killed him is Arthas in his dreamstate in the novel. I don't know if he could do that. I also seem to remember the latest Twitter chat with the devs mentioning that they haven't told Ner'zhul's story yet in-game for a reason - because it's a good one and they want to do it right.\n\nIf he did? No, Ner'zhul can't corrupt Bolvar.\nIf he didn't, and Ner'zhul lives? I would say it's more than likely, and I'd say Blizzard are leaving the question over Ner'zhul's death unanswered for a reason.\n\n(Do note, though, that Arthas proved fairly easy to corrupt, in part due to personality traits (he was headstrong and slightly arrogant) which Bolvar does not share. Plus, Bolvar held out for a year against the Lich King already. I'd say it would be a lot harder to break Bolvar. On the other hand, looking at the cinematic, I think Bolvar was frightening (Tirion did the classic backing-away thing, and Bolvar's voice changed at the end) and I think he was frightening for a reason. \n\n[quote]What will Tirion do, now that Both the Crusade and Scourge have been delt with?[/quote]\nPresumably he'll go back to Stormwind with Varian, and act as a voice of reason. Or he'll be helping to deal with the Cataclysm events (I seem to remember that the Plaguelands is being changed up a lot, meaning maybe the Dawn will take it back?)\n\nOr, in three expansion's time, when the new Lich King unleases unholy hell on Azeroth again, he'll be banished again when people find out he (literally) crowned the King of the Damned. Who knows.\n\n[quote]He is told to not tell anyone, however both Sylvanis and Jaina know their must always be a Lich King.[/quote]\nWell, they know what Uther told them. Presumably they'll keep it quiet for the good of Azeroth. Or they'll listen when Tirion tells them that the Lich King is dead, nod, smile, and make a mental note to keep an eye on Icecrown...just in case.\n\n[quote]and lastly,\nDoes this mean that the Light is more powerful then the Scourge? As it helped Bovar survive Arthas's endless torture.[/quote]\nPaladins were immune to the plague due to the fact that they were imbued with the Light, so we know it's at least particularly resilient to shadow magic and disease. On the other hand, Bolvar is on fire because Alexstrasza breathed on him, and her flames bring life (if you look at the ground, they cause flowers to grow.) I think it's debatable whether the Light kept him alive, or whether Alexstrasza's flames did. As for the survival of the torture in a mental (remaining good) sense? Certainly.\n\nEdits:\n[quote]\nDont get me wrong, im not saying its true or untrue, but the first thing I thought about when I read that was: Onyxia had a human disguise in Stormwind too, Bolvar spent alot of time in Stormwind.. perhaps he planned this, perhaps that explains why he was not killed or purified and/or why Arthas could not break him.. Perhaps thats why Alexstrasza's flames affected him so.\n\nJust saying..[/quote]\n\nI'm not quite sure what you're saying here. Are you saying that Onyxia took a human form and hid in Katrana Prestor in Stormwind so maybe Deathwing did too and hid in Bolvar?\n\nIf so:\n[ul]\n[li]Deathwing did take a human form - Lord Daval Prestor. He attempted to cause strife during the Second War by buttering up Terenas so that he could marry Calia Menethil (Arthas' sister.) [/li]\n[li]You can also see Deathwing in human form during the fight with Yogg-Saron. He looks nothing like Bolvar.[/li]\n[li]If Deathwing had somehow been Bolvar, why would Bolvar aid in the original Onyxia attunement quest which involved Katrana Prestor being thrown out of Stormwind? You know, what with Onyxia being Deathwing's daughter and everything. Surely he'd just have dismissed your claim when you brought it to him, then had you killed quietly later.[/li]\n[/ul]", "date": "2010-02-03T13:13:39-06:00", "rating": 37, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Im sorry if I repeat something in your comment but there have been rumors that when Sylvanas went to The Frozen Throne she took the shards of Frostmourne she made them into arrows.

However Ner'zhul can still exist, but I believe at the very least I can safely say that most of his will/memories have been destroyed.[/quote]\r\nAccording to Metzen, both Ner'zhul and Arthas were fused into one singular being. According to the book, Arthas dominates the Lich King in this fusion; while it does seem to imply that Ner'zhul was killed, lore implies more strongly that the Lich King is both and neither at once. It's an entity by itself. Quests in the Icecrown (like when the Lich King claims that he was once a Shaman) further implies that both share the body.\r\n\r\nThe fusion was created as soon as the Arthas put on that crown, meaning that everything that was the old Lich King (memories, powers, etc) was contained inside of that crown too. Once the two fused, that means everything that was Arthas was contained inside of that helm too, mixing with Ner'zhul.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the helm gets thrown off in the video, Arthas no longer has vision; all he sees is darkness, and his once-glowing eyes become normal. He no longer has a distorted voice, and seems to recognize his father's presence before his death. We can attribute that to \"normal\" Arthas -- this was due to his separation from both the crown's control, and having his soul released by the Frostmourne.\r\n\r\nWhen Bolvar puts on the helmet, he gains glowing eyes and the Lich King's voice. He fuses with the Lich King entity of Ner'zhul and Arthas, just as Arthas did. From watching the video, he just *seems* very sinister. Bolvar seems inexplicably drawn to that helmet, and appears to be single-minded and focused on it. And with the Lich King discussing how he tortured Bolvar's soul, how he was to be his next great Champion, and how Yogg-Saron showed that he influenced this torture, it all seems to amount to the scenario being far more than what we may think, which I think just makes it more epic.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to say, maybe Bolvar *didn't* ultimately resist the Lich King's torture. Maybe it was planned; maybe, all along, the entity that was the Lich King knew that it needed a new host, one that would be left alone by Azeroth while the Scourge recoups. One that needed the world to think the Lich King was dead, and that the Scourge was no longer a danger. And Bolvar seems like the perfect candidate.", "date": "2010-02-04T11:57:18-06:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Saurfang gets slain by Frostmourne (and the Lich King does something that looks like extracting a soul or something), and Grand Apothecary Putress attacks the Lich King with his own plague, weakening the Lich King - and killing the remains of the Horde and Alliance forces in the process. Then Alexstrasza and her Red Dragonflight comes and scorches the ground, removing Putress's plague. When you come back from the cutscene, all soldiers at the Alliance, and Horde base is fleeing in terror, and Alexstrasza and Korialstrasz are talking in the aftermath of the battle. Their conversation is:\n    \nKorialstrasz says: My Queen, do they know? \n    Alexstrasza the Life-Binder says: No, my beloved. \n    Alexstrasza the Life-Binder says: [Draconic] Ashj zila gul kirasath lok ante il lok buras danashj Gul gul \n    Korialstrasz nods. \n    Korialstrasz says: They will not. \n    Alexstrasza whispers: Come to me, <name>. \n\nIf you had completed the quest-chain involving Ahn'Qiraj, on the test servers, you were able to understand what Alexstrasza said, and it is: They must not discover the fate of the young paladin. Not yet. \nThis implies that Bolvar maybe survived one way or another. My personal theory is that both Bolvar and Saurfang will be a boss encounter in the raid version of Icecrown Citadel that is to be released in a future patch. One of the reasons why I believe this, is because I hope it is like that. Second is because it would be a great demoraliser to both the Horde and Alliance to see their former Heroes turned into Death Knights of the Scourge.", "date": "2009-03-08T17:32:32-05:00", "rating": 10, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Before I mention anything, if you disagree go ahead and downrate.
