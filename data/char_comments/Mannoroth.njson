It also makes your circle for his Gaze of Mannoroth spell larger as well, most likely due to the fact that the Vrykul model used for this toy has a bigger hitbox than the normal player races or costumes do. Depending on when you get the costume it can be a blessing or a curse, since it could allow more people to soak you during Gaze, but it could also require you to move farther if you are targeted by Mark of Doom.

Varo'then has a melee ability that will hit 2 other nearby targets.  So range just make sure your not standing by the melee.\r\n\r\n[b]Phase 2[/b]:  Once Varo'then is dead phase 2 starts.  Not sure if this part has changed but basically Varo'then drops his weapon and you throw it at Mannoroth.  After that attacks on mannoroth have a chance of proccing an arc that does 200,000 damage to mannoroth.  During phase 2 dreadlord debillitators will incapacitate Tyrande and the tank will have to pick up the demons constantly flowing through the portals while your dps kill the debillitators.  once their dead tyrande will kill all the demons and your dps can go back to killing mannoroth.  As mannoroths health lowers more demons will stream out of the portal.\r\n\r\n[b]Phase 3[/b]:  When mannoroth hits about 20% health your tank will have to help tyrande again by picking up all the adds.  illidan will give your party a immolation type aura that will damage nearby enemies so don't worry too much about killing the demons as the aura will take care of that for you.  Just hold onto them and the healer needs to heal through the damage.  The dps will continue dpsing mannoroth till he hits 1% hp.

After you jump on the dragons from beating Queen Azshara, there's no need to sit through the cutscreen each time. Talk to your dragon by right clicking the mount and you can skip ahead. \r\n\r\nStrategy for easy kill: This fight is not terribly taxing, but can result in deaths because of poor knowledge of the fight.\r\n\r\n1) Attack Varo'then. NOT the big guy (Mannoroth) - he'll heal up if you don't attack the small boss anyway. So it's just wasted time and dps.\r\n\r\n2) When Fel Firestorm is being cast, just keep on the move - run around in a circle. They hit fairly hard and can cause deaths easily for people standing in the fire, ahem. They seem to target a player and fall from the sky, much like the first boss in Baradin Hold. So if you start moving as it begins, it will fall where you were one second before. It is easily possible to avoid almost all damage if you are on the move.\r\n\r\n3) When Tyrande collapses and the adds mob her, everyone run into the light, get the buff, and then KILL THE TWO ADDS TO THE SIDES (Dreadlord Debilitator). It's amusing (to a point) to watch groups kill wave after wave of the melee adds (they're endless afaik). All you have to do is kill the Debilitators and they will release their glowey thread debuffing Tyrande and you can continue with the fight. **Notes: with the buff, you do ridiculous damage to demons, so even the healer can pop a quick moonfire or something similar and kill them.\r\n\r\n4) Throw the sword left behind (right click it) to debuff Mannoroth, then bust him up.\r\n\r\n5) To make the fight easier on the tank and do more overall dps, a little placement is worth doing. The adds all stream from a portal to the left of the boss. Have the tank right of the boss (or wherever, doesn't matter too much), have heals stack on the tank, and have range dps stand right behind tank in a direct line from the portal. This way the tank can just dps the boss while cleaving, and he'll pick up all the adds as they stream over him.\r\n\r\nHave fun.", "date": "2011-12-03T11:45:49-06:00", "rating": 25, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You can ignore tip one and dps mannoroth instead for an achievement, the tank still needs to keep Varo'then busy.", "creationdate": "2011-12-03T15:49:30-06:00", "id": 282449, "rating": 3, "commentid": 1588076, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "829084", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Achieve is slightly easier on the heals if you've got a smart Blood DK (and probably a smart Pally as well) for a tank: Magistrike accounts for almost all of the damage done to the party in P1-- if the tank kites the Boss far enough away, only the tank will suffer Magistrike- and Blood DKs?

Though he battled with brutal ferocity and millions fell at his four feet, he was defeated by Cenarius and his followers and sent back into the Twisting Nether as the Well of Eternity was destroyed.\r\n\r\nMannoroth's defeat:\r\nAfter Thrall reclaimed Hellscream, Mannoroth lured them into the craters formed by the falling infernals, where he hoped to battle them to the death. Thrall confronted the demon lord in battle pouring all his strength and hatred for the demon into one powerful blast with the Doomhammer. Mannoroth applauded the effort and revealed the extent of the damage: his left wing had been torn slightly. The powerful Mannoroth tossed the young war chief across the crater leaving only Hellscream. Mannoroth reminded Grom that he owned his body and soul and gloated that the blood curse could never be broken.\r\n\r\nHellscream then faced the choice between giving into the demon corruption once more or resisting and saving Thrall. Refusing to accept that the Orcs were cursed forever, he chose his kin. In a heroic last stand Grom slipped past Mannoroth\u2019s defenses and sliced open his chest. The demonic fires erupted outward, slaying the astonished Mannoroth and mortally wounding Hellscream.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Mannoroth the blood curse on the Orcs was finally lifted. After his defeat, Mannoroth's remains and armor were spirited to Orgrimmar and were attached to a large, irregularly shaped tree. However the large double blade used by the mighty pit lord remains in Ashenvale locked in time to show where the bloodpact was ended.
