It's in reference to something that happened in the very, very beginning of WoD.  If you can recall, right after you accept Khadgar's mission, you end up leaping through the Dark Portal to an alternate Draenor, where you end up shutting down the Portal to keep the Iron Horde from going through anymore than they already have.  You're trapped and alone - but wait, maybe not!  After shutting down the portal, you sneak off behind it and head out into the jungle, in the process saving hapless draenei and gathering allies.  Right after you [url=http://www.wowhead.com/quest=34423/altar-altercation]part ways with Ariok[/url], you end up getting [url=http://www.wowhead.com/quest=34429/kill-your-hundred]trapped in an arena[/url].  And the circle is complete.  After that, it's a mad dash through several more quests, a quick boat ride where you part ways with your Horde or Alliance counterparts, and make a landing in Shadowmoon Valley or Frostfire Ridge to build a fort.  =P\n\nAfterwards, there's a cinematic where apparently Cho'gall breaks free and escapes and the Imperator has a minor freak out and locks down the complex.\n\n[quote]Imperator Mar'gok says:  Cho'gall!\nCho'gall says:  You thought to imprison us, Mar'gok?

Unfortunately non-elite adds pour into the area at a steady clip. For most groups and pugs you need to put a melee DPS character on the stairs strictly to take care of these. They're weak but they pile up and can do annoying things like scattershot. Try to avoid spending a lot of time on the stairs or floor in front of the stairs because this tends to bring assassins, which are elite.\r\n\r\n3.

He basically takes off and charges randomly from party member to party member VERY VERY quickly, delivering a cleave for about 1-1.5k each charge. He hits about 5-7 targets from what I can see. It's not a huge amount of damage but if everyone's standing together he can almost instantly butcher clothies. He doesn't dump aggro during this so if you're tanking, you'd be better off just standing still so you don't accidentally bring a cleave down on your party members. Unless the tank barely had aggro on him Kargath will dutifully go back to pummeling the tank after his dance.\r\n\r\nThat's it. Adds come, and he does his blade dance regularly. This is a pure DPS check. If you don't have enough DPS to keep the adds down and kill Kargath before the healers hit empty even when he's only hitting one person per charge in his Blade Dance, you ain't beating this fight.

The key is maximum and even distance between everyone. If you have a melee DPS, stick them where the adds come in and just handle the adds, then tank him in the back and reposition ranged so that there's an equal distance between everyone.\r\n\r\nMy theory is that the total Blade Dance is distance-based, both on choice of next target and total travel length. Hence why it works to spread out, so that you minimize the possibility that he can loop through twice to the same target--like say BD is 50m long and you're 10m apart, there are 5 hits that will happen in those 50m, whereas if you could be 25m apart (you can't due to the room size), only 2 hits could happen. \r\n\r\nJust a theory based on how it seems to work. Regardless of the actual truth of it, any two people being too close together is a fatal mistake on this, T6 or not. Anybody with less than 9K health in cloth is also at risk for immediate termination on a Dance. Two hits and you're done. It's a near thing every time I've killed him on Heroic, and it usually ends with at least one person dead and the tank holding multiple un-CCd adds as you attempt to do a max burn down through the last 20%.\r\n\r\nAlso bear in mind that if you're going for the Trials or the other timed quest here, Kargath is not the Executioner.
