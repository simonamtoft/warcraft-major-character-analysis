In the beginning the earthen were created to--\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] Right, right... I know the earthen were made from stone to shape the deep regions o' the world. But what about the anomalies? Matrix non-stabilizin' and what-not?\n\n[b]Abedneum:[/b] Accessing... In the early stages of it's development cycle, Azeroth suffered infection by parasitic necrophotic symbiotes.\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] Necrowhatinthe-- Speak bloody Common, will ye?\n\n[b]Abedneum:[/b] Designation: Old Gods. Old Gods rendered all systems, including earthen, defenseless in order to facilitate assimilation. This matrix destabilization has been termed \"the Curse of Flesh\". Effects of destabilization increased over time.\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] Old Gods, huh? So they zapped the earthen with this Curse of Flesh... and then what?\n\n[b]Kaddrak:[/b] Accessing... Creators arrived to extirpate symbiotic infection. Assessment revealed that Old God infestation had grown malignant. Excising parasites would result in loss of host--\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] If they killed the Old Gods, Azeroth would've been destroyed...\n\n[b]Kaddrak:[/b] Correct. Creators neutralized parasitic threat and contained it within the host. Forge of Wills and other systems were instituted to create new earthen. Safeguards were implemented, and protectors were appointed.\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] What protectors?\n\n[b]Kaddrak:[/b] Designations: Aesir and Vanir. Or in the common nomenclature, storm and earth giants. Sentinel Loken designated supreme. Dragon Aspects appointed to monitor evolution on Azeroth.\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] Aesir and Vanir... Okay, so the Forge o' Wills started makin' new earthen... but what happened to the old ones?\n\n[b]Marnak yells:[/b] Additional background is relevant to your query: following global combat between Aesir and Vanir--\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] Hold everything! The Aesir and Vanir went to war? Why?\n\n[b]Marnak:[/b] Unknown. Data suggests that impetus for global combat originated with prime designate Loken, who neutralized all remaining Aesir and Vanir, affecting termination of conflict. Prime designate Loken then initiated stasis of several seed races, including earthen, giants and vrykul, at designated holding facilities.\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] This \"Loken\" sounds like a nasty character. Glad we don't have to worry about the likes o' him anymore. So... if I'm understandin' ye right, the original earthen eventually woke up from this stasis, and by that time the destabili-whatever had turned 'em into proper dwarves. Or at least... dwarf ancestors.\n\n[b]Marnak:[/b] Essentially that is correct.\n\n[b]Brann:[/b] Well, now... that's a lot to digest. I'm gonna need some time to take all this in.

Any luck finding a way to teleport inside? \r\n    Archamge Rhydian yells: None at all. I suspect it has something to do with that giant mechanical construct that our scouts spotted in front of the gate. \r\n    Brann Bronzebeard yells: What about the plated proto-drake and the fire giant that were spotted nearby? Think your mages can handle those? \r\n    Archmage Rhydian yells: The Kirin Tor can't possibly spare any additional resources to take on anything that size. We may not have to though. \r\n    Archmage Rhydian yells: We can sneak past them. As long as we can take down that construct in front of the gate, we should be able to get inside. \r\n    Brann Bronzebeard yells: Sneak? [u]What do you think we are, marmots?[/u] \r\n    Archmage Rhydian yells: We're hunting an old god, Brann. \r\n    Brann Bronzebeard yells: Fine. If our allies are going to be the ones getting their hands dirty, we'll leave it to them to decide how to proceed. \r\n\r\nThe underlined segment is a clear reference to Project Marmot, the [url=http://www.tankspot.com/]Tankspot[/url] crew that churns out helpful guides to raid bosses.
