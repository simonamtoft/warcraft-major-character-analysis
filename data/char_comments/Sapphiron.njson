The attack will hit the ground then \u201csplash\u201d outward.

Sapphiron was magnificently powerful, and protected the lands of Northrend as best he could. Though Ner'zhul's malevolent influence defiled the Dragonblight, Sapphiron and his brood continued to guard his hoard of treasure from any and all intruders. \r\n\r\nSapphiron and his brood lived in relative peace until King Arthas, champion of the Lich King, was suddenly called back to Northrend to save his weakening master, Ner'zhul. After three weeks at sea, the Death Knight landed on the shores of Northrend near Sapphiron's frozen lair, and was greeted almost immediately by the Crypt Lord Anub'arak, King of Azjol-Nerub, another powerful servant of Ner'zhul. Anub'arak had sensed Sapphiron nearby and suggested to the young Death Knight that perhaps by equipping themselves with the ancient blue wyrm's treasures, he and Arthas might be better prepared for the perilous journey through the underground kingdom of Azjol-Nerub to Icecrown Glacier. Arthas agreed, and boldly journeyed into Sapphiron's lair with Anub'arak. \r\n\r\nThe two servants of the Lich King fought their way through Sapphiron's minions till they finally reached the great blue dragon himself. Sapphiron confronted the undead as they approached him. He found Arthas's honesty about killing him and stealing his treasure quite \"refreshing\". Sapphiron and his fellow dragons attacked with all their might, unleashing their strange, cold frost magics upon them. In the end, despite all odds, Arthas was victorious, and Sapphiron was defeated. As a final, clinching victory, however, Arthas used what remained of his dwindling necromatic power to recreate Sapphiron as a frost wyrm to serve the Scourge. \r\n\r\nSapphiron, now a mighty frost wyrm, assisted Arthas in destroying the Naga and Blood Elf forces blocking the passage to Azjol-Nerub. Sapphiron was called upon again to destroy the dwarves guarding the gates to Azjol-Nerub, but the great dragon was left outside of the tunnels, where he guarded it against all who would disturb his new master. \r\n\r\nSome years later the Scourge attacked once again and Sapphiron was sent with Kel'Thuzad to the Eastern Plaguelands to guard the Black Citadel Naxxramas. \r\n\r\nSapphiron's powers are significantly greater than those of the average Frost Wyrm. This could be because Arthas, the Lich King's champion, revived him personally, or it could be a reflection of Sapphiron's greater power in life, or it could be some combination of both. \r\n\r\nCommander Eligor Dawnbringer: \"Sapphiron. Once a noble blue dragon within the mountains of Northrend, Sapphiron was slain by Arthas during his campaign through the frozen north. Resurrected to serve him, Sapphiron guards Kel'Thuzad's lair eternally, awaiting those who would dare trespass upon his master.\" \r\n\r\nTaken from wowwiki", "date": "2008-12-10T18:05:29-06:00", "rating": 35, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

This can become extremely irritating because the raid needs to stay behind an ice block to avoid death, but at the same time a blizzard is WTF pwning everyone with nothing we can do. Originally, my group was very frustrated that luck was part of the boss fight. After reading comments here and watching videos, there a few solutions that you can use if this happens to be the case during the fight. One way is to just have your healers AoE heal you (really only a solution if you're overgeared for the instance). Another is to start the air phase at one side of the room, then run as fast as you can to the other side so that the blizzard will take awhile to catch up to you.  Finally, staying somewhat spread out not only makes it so that fewer people are hit by the ice bolt AoE but also forces the blizzard to keep switching targets so that it is only one one person instead of an entire group. Waiting to collapse only after the second ice bolt allows maximum distance between your group and the blizzard before he does his frost breath. Hopefully this helps anyone who is having similar problems. But yes, luck is somewhat part of this encounter.

Pally healers are just shafted here. If we have a pally healer at this boss we tend to just have them assigned to MT heal and off heal when someone is real low(On a side note I'd love to be able to 2 heal this with a paladin but I have not as yet found a paladin geared/skilled enough to achieve this, im a resto shaman and go oom if I have to heal more than 6 people really)\r\n\r\n2. Priests/Shamans/Druids is what its all about here. Priests and Druids can keep a 5 man group alive here, whilst a shaman can easily keep 3 but with a little effort keep a 5 man group up.\r\n\r\n3. In the ground phase. Have the ranged groups split into two groups, left and right, all the melee are obviously all in the centre. Have 1 decurser for each of these groups(its much much better if the decurser is NOT a healer) assign 1 healer left 1 healer right, this splits up the blizzards as two are cast at once and if you are on one side all together there is a chance they can converge and wipe you\r\n\r\n4. In the air phase, have the whole raid run towards the entrance to the encounter this means you are away from the blizzards, that all the people dont have far to run for ice bolts it also means you are in range of all the aoe healers(nb if someone goes into an ice block at low hp it is essential for a healer to use a cooldown to save them the instant they come out). At this point any druid of any spec in your raid should use tranquility as it is an imba spell at the minute :)\r\n\r\nThe main things that cause a wipe here are :\r\n\r\n- Healer oom - This will come if you have poor dps or poor gear, only solution is to either swap people out or get more healers through respecs. Can also happen if people are being stupid and standing in blizzards\r\n\r\n- The boss healing up - This will only occur if people are not decursing. Explain to them this is priority 1 over another frostfirebolt/starfire etc\r\n\r\n- Unlucky Ice Bolts - You do need to keep your raid over about 50% hp at all times to avoid this, again this can be hard depending on healer spellpower but again more healers will resolve this problem.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps :)\r\n\r\nNb. The achievement 100 club is actually a really easy one as the frost resist set just doesnt seem to mitigate more than it gimps the healer mana and dps's dps.", "date": "2009-01-09T05:46:53-06:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

On 1st try my paladin friend was going just fine with earth shield and most of time I was \"dpsing\" boss. Aura isn't a problem too - it seems to be mostly outhealed by JoL and healing stream totem. I think that way better geared tank won't require healing at all.\n\n2) The pain in ass is drain life. If you can't dispell it you need to outheal it. [spell=28542 domain=www] - it really does like 20k damage and will apply to both of you. So if you are tank+hybrid and can't dispell you should screw DPS and heal up.\n\n3) Both of you will receive a personal Ice Block so you don't need to hide on air phase.\n\n4) If noone of you is a healer you should think about dealing with Blizzard. [spell=28547 domain=www] - it will hit for 3.5-4.5k every two seconds. 1st thing is that boss has HUGE hitbox and dps mate has lot of space to move. 2nd thing is that blizz seems to \"follow\" a person, so most of fight we were spinning boss like dark side Halion and got almost no blizzard hits at all.\n\n5) The enrage timer is 15 minutes which means that you two should pull like 4.7k dps together. But.\n - Ofc it's not hard if you just pump Patchwerk-like boss. \n- Flying phase also shortens the time you can dps the boss. He'll fly for like 15 seconds every 45 seconds. Roughly said, you'll waste 25% of time in ice blocks. 15 mins - 20% = 12.25 minutes and it's 5.7k dps to down him. \n- You'll waste time moving from blizzard, healing drain life and keeping up your tank which means even more time, damage and mana loss.\n\n\nMargerie (Ru-Soulflayer)\n\n\nHope this helps.
