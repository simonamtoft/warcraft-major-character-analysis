All items are only usable in the Broken Isles.  \n\nEach time you access the vault, you will get to choose between a number of different (random) treasures.  These will have a purple glow around them in the vault.  Choose wisely!  You only get to keep ONE object.\n[ul]\n[li]Note that the treasures available rotate daily.

Apparently this can be done until something is looted.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nSome of the items you can obtain are listed below - many are consumable items, but there is also a [b]Toy[/b]:\n[ul]\n[li][object=252267] - often contains gold.[/li]\n[li][item=141408] - BoE purple cosmetic hood and mask.  This can sometimes be looted from the [object=252267].[/li]\n[li][item=139589] (8 charges) - similar to Sap, but with a longer range.

Pre-emptive CC (e.g. [item=97156], which can be purchased in the initial preparation room of the scenario for [currency=697]) can ensure he doesn\u2019t get too far away.  100% drop rate for [item=95497].[/li]\n[li]Dropped by [npc=70400] at the very end of the scenario (if you reach there before time is up).  100% drop rate for [item=95497].[/li]\n[li]Rewarded by [npc=70321] at the very end of the scenario.
