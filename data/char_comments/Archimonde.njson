One person dies and you've got a 50/50 shot of living.\r\n\r\nCouple notes: The doomfire takes a second or two to actually give you the DoT.  Rogues can cloak it/you can bubble or iceblock it.

You take no durability loss from dying this way.\r\n\r\nPurification pots(http://www.wowhead.com/?item=13462 ) may come in handy for this fight too.  Often times he will use air burst on someone and then grip them immediately after.(though this is subject to fixing in patch 2.2 I believe, so it will be no longer relevant.)\r\n\r\nThe key to this fight is mobility and individual execution.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 26, "id": 246445, "nreplies": 6, "sticky": 0, "user": "RiceCake", "body": "Archimonde is, without a doubt, one of the hardest bosses in TBC. He is arguably the trickiest and most unforgiving. In fact, I've heard that the average amount of wipes needed to down Archimonde is somewhere around 70, an incredibly large number for one single encounter. Even though the wipes occur very fast most of the time, resulting in actually not a lot of wasted time, our guild saved a lot of wipes (actually making a horde side record for our server) by running attempts \"dry.\" This means that we do NOT dps at all in all of our attempts until we can be sure that everyone survives at least 5 minutes of the encounter. The necessity to run such dps-less attempts should be clearer to you as I present to you his strategy below.\r\n\r\nNecessary equipment:\r\n-Medallion or Insignia of the Horde/Alliance on all of your healers and most if not all of your raid, excluding your main tank.\r\n\r\n-Tears of the Goddess in the inventory of EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the raid. The item should be on everyone's hot bars and bounded to an easy-to-access key. Get it from Tyrande Whisperwind in the Night Elf camp, and make sure that it at least has 20 minutes left on it (disappears every 2 hours). Whenever a wipe occurs, everyone in the raid should check if the tear is still in his/her inventory.\r\n\r\nSuggested Raid Makeup:\r\n-Melee: bring a lot of melee, they shine in this encounter.\r\n\r\n-Shamans: Try to aim for at least one shaman a group if you're having trouble with his fear fearing people into fires.\r\n\r\n-Decursers: There should be at least one decurser in every group.\r\n\r\n-Healers: A normal amount of healers should suffice (7-8), however, make sure at least one healer is in each group.\r\n\r\nBoss Abilities:\r\n-Finger of Death: Instantly deals 20,000 damage to a single target. This ability is cast only when Archimonde has no melee in range to attack. You shouldn't have to worry about this ability if nothing majorly faulty happens.\r\n\r\n-Hand of Death: Instantly deals 99,999 damage to everyone. This shouldn't be a problem if you keep him on solid ground away from the well. This is also his enrage ability (10 minutes timer).\r\n\r\n-Melee: He hits fairly hard for around 7-8k on a fully geared tank. Since he swings with his fists he hits fairly fast too. While he cannot crit, the swing timer reset with a parry could burst your tank down really fast. Make sure there're at least two healers on your main tank at all times, if not all of your healers.\r\n\r\n-Air Burst: He randomly targets a person and casts this on him/her. The person, as well as everyone within 13 yards of him, will get thrown very very high into the air (along with ~3k damage). If the person lands without levitate / slowfall, it is a 100% guaranteed death. However, the required item Tears of the Goddess will enable the player to slow fall for ~3 seconds. After the 3 seconds the person again falls. To prevent Air Burst from killing people, have them activate the Tear just seconds before they land. Remember it is always better to take a bit of fall damage due to clicking the Tear earlier than dying to lag due to clicking the Tear late.\r\n\r\n-Grip of the Legion: A curse that he randomly casts on players that deals 2500 damage every 2 seconds for 5 MINUTES. Have decursers decurse this immediately.\r\n\r\n-Doomfire: These are trails of fire that follow a specific person, leaving flames that tick for ~2.5k every second if stepped upon. Once a person gets hit with the fire, he/she will also get a debuff that ticks for ~2.5k initially then less with every tick for ~40 seconds. The doomfires travel fairly fast and will twist and turn from switching targets. GET AWAY from them as soon as possible and stay far away from them. Only 3 of these will be up at any given time but they're really long, so it is very possible for a group of people to get trapped by the fire. Prevent this as best as you can by running in straight lines, leaving the fire to go straight most of the time.\r\n\r\n-Fear: A 1 second cast fear that fears the raid for 5 seconds every 30 seconds. Every healer should have the PvP trinket on and every healer should be on a rotation. 2 Healers should use their trinkets to keep healing the tank every single fear. Keep fear ward on your main tank (or he can stance dance). Due to this fear + fires, every person should stay as far away from doomfires as possible. They should also use their trinkets if they're going to be feared into a fire.\r\n\r\n-Soul Charges: The raid wiper and what makes this encounter so tricky. Once a person dies (to anything), Archimonde will gain a soul charge. He can unleash this charge at any given time with 3 varieties. If the soul charge is from a hunter, shaman, or druid, the raid will be dealt 4.5k damage over 8 seconds. If the soul charge is from a warrior, rogue, or paladin, the raid will be dealt ~5k physical damage and any damage received after that will be increased by 50% for 8 seconds. If the soul charge is from a mage, warlock, or priest, everyone will be dealt around ~4k magic damage and be silenced for ~5 seconds. All of these AoE effects have a knockdown effect, and if anyone is killed by the Soul Charge, Archimonde will again acquire their soul. Pretty much if anyone dies, he'll soul charge the raid and kill one or two more, then soul charge again and again until the raid dies. It is possible to completely survive one soul charge, especially the DoT, but this ability usually means that if anyone dies, the fight is over.\r\n\r\nPositioning: Try to tank Archimonde in the middle of the open area. Split your raid into 5 groups: melee, East, West, North, and South group. The melee should stay in melee range, and the other 4 ranged groups should spread out as a cross around him, standing on one another and max ranging Archimonde.\r\n\r\nOverall Strat: If you have a healer and a decurser in every group (a shaman too if possible), each group will be one unit that could survive on their own. If a group gets Air Bursted, they have a healer to top them off and a decurser to remove the Grip. If a group gets feared, they have a shaman to Tremor Totem them out of it. If they need to run away from fire, the whole group runs away together. This way you greatly increase the chance of survival as opposed to everyone running around doing their own business. Keep a trinket rotation on the healers to make sure the main tank gets topped off. The melee should spread out behind him to avoid air bursting the main tank when they get targeted. However, they should be at a distance where when the doomfire spawns they can immediately move away from them.\r\n\r\nYou raid's success really is in the hand of everyone. Bring your most situationally-aware raiders, and realize that this fight is in no way a DPS fight but a survival one. Practice using the Tears jumping off the cliffs by the Elven Village. Practice running out of fires / decursing by not dps'ing in attempts. Use the trinkets to avoid extra damage that healers have to heal through, and just be ready to move constantly. Make sure you're always near a decurser to avoid the Grip from killing you.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to down Archimonde to 10% hp, he'll run away and start Hand of Death'ing the raid. However, the elves will put a shield on everyone that avoids all damage done. All healing effects and buffs will not work (along with life tap) at this point, and all you have to do is DPS him down. I'm not sure if he automatically gets killed by the wisps even if you don't dps him, but this last 10% is in", "date": "2008-03-01T22:25:20-06:00", "rating": 71, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "essence a \"free kill.\"  Archimonde is known for raid kicks on players that just can't run away from fires/ use the Tears.

Without these you will never be able to kill him.  He will knock certain raid members into the air and these will slow falling time for 2 seconds, without them, the falling damage will kill you.\r\n\r\nWhen your whole raid has these, continue down the path and around the tree.  This fight will require all consumables so use everything, even if you are going to wipe.  Ok, you need at least 5 decurses, they make the raid successful.  Place a mark over each of the decursers heads so that players know who to go to when they get the Grip of the Legion, which is a curse that will kill that player it does 250,000 dmg over 5 mins or something like that.  DECURSERS, DECURSING IS YOUR MAIN JOB.  If you have to sacrifice DPS to decurse someone, DO IT.  Always be on the lookout and have Decursive or Xperl or something to help you.  Make sure that the decursers are spread out to avoid them clumping up and missing half the raid.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a decurser, your job is to DPS Archimonde/heal and not die.  If you die, the whole raid is affected by the debuffs above the comments.  It is almost better to remove 2 idiots and 23 man this guy because a few guys that don't understand how important it is to not die can wipe the raid.\r\n\r\nDPSers and everyone in the raid needs to watch out for the fire that shows up on the ground.  It travels pretty fast, and if it hits you it will take a toll.  You have 10 minutes and he can go down pretty fast with a geared raid so stop dpsing when fire gets close and move away from it.  Sometimes it will follow you.\r\n\r\nAir burst can wipe the raid if you aren't careful.  This is where those tears come in handy.  He will shoot a few people flying in to the air, and they have to correctly time when to use the item and not die.  This will take much practice but you can eventually get it.\r\n\r\nWatch for fear as well, every 30 seconds he will fear the raid and this is where PvP trinkets are useful, just make sure that all of the healers don't use theirs the first time.  Otherwise, there will be no healers for the next one and that's a goodbye to the tank.  If you are near a fire and a fear is coming soon, move away fast.  It will fear you into the fire.\r\n\r\nOnce you get Archimonde to 10% health, you win.  Your screen will flash red as he runs and trys to use the tree to survive.  Wisps will come and attack him along with you, and you will get a buff that doesn't allow you to take damage or get healed.  Just dps him down, even if somehow your whole raid is dead and he is at 10% the wisps kill him and you get the loot.\r\n\r\nA fun and fairly easy fight, just watch the fire, use the tears at the right time, get the PvP trinkets on AND DECURSE. YOU GOTTA DECURSE.  My first down of him, the raid had 12 healers so you can see how flexible dps is.

If the Fear is left unchecked however, raid members will often find themselves running into Doomfire.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][u][b]Air Burst[/b][/u]: The raid [b]must[/b] understand the severity of getting hit by this. It is a knock-up that keeps you up in the air for about 5 seconds or so until you hit the ground. To counter this, use the Tears of the Goddess given to you by Tyrande at about [u]1-2 seconds[/u] before hitting the ground. It will grant you a slowfall buff that only lasts 2 seconds, which is why you should wait before using it. Often times, you won't die by taking the full fall damage, but it still puts quite a strain on your healers should you fail. Thus, white lying to your raid that they [b]will[/b] die isn't a bad thing to do.[/li]\r\n[ul]\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][u][b]Finger of Death[/b][/u]: As strange as this sounds, emphasize as much as you can that there must always be a target within Archimonde's melee range. At a point in our first attempt, the tank was Air Bursted while no one else was near the boss, causing us quite a silly wipe.[/li]\r\n[/ul]\r\nThe overall damage that the raid takes is quite trivial if they're on the ball on moving out of Doomfires and using Tears of the Goddess effectively.
