Because of this, he was unable to visit his ancestial homeland of Pandaria. Eventually he left the Wandering Isle to explore the world for new brewing ingredients not found in his home.\r\nChen's journeys eventually brought him to the land of Durotar, and his latest brew had a plethora of strange ingredients that he feared would be too hard to acquire. He almost lost hope for his recipe when he was met by Rexxar the travelling Beastmaster. Chen asked Rexxar to retrieve the ingredients for his brew - a barrel of Thunderwater, the egg of a thunder phoenix, and a sprig of thunderbloom.\r\nChen was overjoyed when Rexxar returned with the ingredients, and then mixed his special brew and offered some to Rexxar, who nearly toppled over from the shock of the volatile beverage! Then Rexxar asked if Chen was trying to kill him, probably in the rhetorical sense but possibly not.\r\nChen surmised that he would have to further examine the recipe, having completed one phase of his journey, Chen decided to pause his brewing and join Rexxar's adventure, so that he might better appreciate this beautiful, rugged land he had found himself in.\r\nChen and company went on a secret mission to Theramore Island to help the Horde find out why the humans were attacking them. They met with Jaina Proudmoore, who decided to help them out, after seeing what her father had done. Chen helped Rexxar to defend Thrall and Durotar from Kul Tiras incursions. When the Horde was prepared they launched an attack that ended with the death of Grand Admiral Proudmoore.\r\nAfter the battle Chen spent some time in Durotar teaching the brewmaster ways to the mentor of Brewmaster Drohn before travelling on. No one knows where he left afterwards, but several of his empty kegs have been found scattered throughout the Barrens. Like the rest of his people, he has apparently maintained his independence, joining neither the Horde nor the Alliance.\r\n\r\n- taken from wowpedia.com -", "date": "2012-07-09T03:49:07-05:00", "rating": 17, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I couldn't help but read this in the voice of Lorewalker Cho.", "creationdate": "2013-11-15T01:41:13-06:00", "id": 708219, "rating": 4, "commentid": 1686227, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Gamerstud", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

In the end, when the two were nearly passed out, Chen declared Grimbooze to be superior. However, Grimbooze liked Chen's beer more. After a brief and lighthearted argument, the two decided to hold a contest in Dun Morogh for all dwarves to taste their drinks and decide. Coren Direbrew whined his way into getting a position in the contest as well. In the end, Chen and Grimbooze were neck-in-neck where Coren only had two votes, one from himself and one from Chen out of pity. The Dark Iron attacked then in anger, and Chen fought him off. Grimbooze's brew was declared the victor by a single vote. This contest Chen helped to establish was the origin of Brewfest.\r\n\r\nSome time later, Chen was on a boat departing from Stormwind that was attacked by a group of privateers. They found him sleeping below deck, though when attempting to rob him Chen fought them off swiftly. However, what Chen did not see was a small box in his possession being stolen by a gnome in the privateer crew. The box held a slip of paper reading \"Thunderbrew\", the vote he originally would have cast during the drinking contest before deciding to vote for Coren Direbrew instead.\r\n\r\nIn Stonetalon Mountains, Chen went off searching for a rare ingredient for his drinks when he came across goblin machines in a hidden valley. With the help of a Keeper of the Grove, Keeper Orremin, Chen fought the goblins off. Orremin offered some of the plant in return for saving them, but as it was so rare Chen declined taking it from the valley.\r\n\r\nChen would come across an orc Blademaster named Rahjak, who was looking for great fighters. Chen won the fight, but little did he know how it would come back to haunt him. Humiliated, Rahjak ventured to Outland and drink demon blood, becoming a fel orc so he could have power to win next time.\r\n\r\nHe fought alongside King Magni Bronzebeard for at least part of the Third War and was declared a friend of Ironforge.", "date": "2012-11-13T03:33:31-06:00", "rating": 6, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
