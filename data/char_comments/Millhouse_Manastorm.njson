You're welcome  =P\r\n\r\nOk, bear with me, as I seem to have run across a unique (and possibly idiotic) situation with Millhouse.\r\n\r\nI was in the process of leveling my second toon from 90-100, and picked up the quest \"For The Children\". Having taken my time with my first toon, I had forgotten that there was a significant amount of Garrison Resources necessary to level the Town Hall to level 3, and so I switched my Level 2 Inn out for a Trading Post to help speed up the acquisition of the resources.\r\n\r\nI just so happened to make that switch while I had a bank or 7 or 8 quests from the NPCs at the Inn (which, again, was level 2 before the switch) and had completely forgotten that my Inn on this character had ever been level 2. The only reason I figured this out was because I went to the garrison blueprint vendor to buy the Level 2 Inn blueprint, but already knew it.\r\n\r\nSo, for a couple days now, I've been running around like a fool looking for Millhouse Manastorm, reading about the quest, the varying NPC models of him, asking in /2 (trade channel, which obviously meant I was desperate for an answer...), visiting other folk's garrisons --  all in an attempt to just get the quest out of my quest log (I guess an epic follower is pretty cool, too), and all to no avail.\r\n\r\nSurely, I can't have been the only person to switch my Medium plot out from the Inn to either the Trading Post or the Lumber Mill in an effort to speed along the upgrade to the Level 3 Town Hall, but apparently it hasn't happened too terribly often.\r\n\r\nNow, I know what you're thinking, because someone in Trade said it  --  \"If you can't figure out Garrisons, you're too stupid to play WoW.\"\r\n\r\nFair enough, BUT  --  for those who juggle alts and maybe take a lot of time leveling a character and things aren't quite as fresh in their minds, or have things going on in RL that distract you from even just finishing a simple thought like \"Oh, I'll ... \"  I don't remember what I was going to use as an example.\r\n\r\n[b][i][u]So, the TL;DR[/u][/i][/b] is (approximately) that if you switch out your Inn for another Medium building, while you've got the quest \"For The Children\", you're going to waste a LOT of time looking for and waiting for Millhouse Manastorm, as he just won't be showing up until you upgrade your Inn again.\r\n\r\nHowever, I should note that I came to this conclusion by using all of these as information gathering: roughly 72 hours of checking in periodically to see if he had respawned, looking on wowhead and googling many things, asking people who I personally knew had more experience with the game, and asking folks in trade channel  --  all of which gave me mostly no information to help, which makes me think that it should have been obvious. For some reason, though, it wasn't.\r\n\r\nThis is my first legitimate post explaining any of my experiences in the game after many years of reading the posts of others, so go easy on me. I realize it was a bonehead move, but I can't be the only person that was lost and confused, so I just hope this can help anyone else that finds him/herself in the same situation.\r\n\r\nAnd happy hunting!", "date": "2015-02-08T23:28:31-06:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
