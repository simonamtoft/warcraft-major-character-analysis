If you bring a decent group he is a joke and goes down like a sack of potatoes but I noticed a huge difference when I just invite anyone who asks...I still do for fun and all...What I noticed it is hard to carry this fight by yourself, but what I do to make it easier (as the tank) is put a raid marker above my head so they know to stay on me and run out.  The camera tip on this thread was also very helpful...to have your camera facing backward while tanking and use the mouse to run out...although trying to explain it to my group was like pulling teeth as they seem to run any direction they want.  \n\nSo anyway, depending on whos in your group you are going to either kill this guy with ease or take a few wipes until they figure it out.  Another thing to do is explain to the healer who is on high priority to get healed if he cannot keep everyone up, that way you have a chance.  Some players may have to be \"let go\" by not receiving heals for the overall success of the fight if they are not playing properly.  I'm talking about rogues who not only do not run out of the nova but also do not use cloak of shadows to eat the nova, instead relying on the healer to pamper them.  Rogues who get hit by the nova yet arent even using sprint give me a good laugh too.  I never booted anyone but I guess if you can identify the problem maybe just replace with a better player, because I've let a lot of things slide and let a lot of players stay even when they refuse to shape up...\n\nAt least they know who is running the show when it is just me and the healer left alive over Loken's dead body...or sometimes just me...mostly because Loken's damage is laughable on Death Knight tanks if you pop the right cooldowns at the right time.  I still just invite anyone for the challenge...cuz I dont need his drops at all...but if I was concerned I'd stack the group with DPS who can keep themselves alive while DPSing.\n\nThat means classes like Warlocks, Shadowpriests, Shamans for the elemental resist totems...I usually have poorly played rogues, hunters, and cat druids so I really gotta step it up....class wouldnt matter too much if people knew how to play their class. Talking about crap like the feral druids who dont even HoT themselves up before they run in but wonder why they go down first...yep...just bring a good crew if you are worried about this guy and he is cake.\n\n I'd say any healer works for this also, even did it with a ret paly healing us (no beacon obviously), mostly about the DPS taking unnecessary damage by not running out or running too far away or running in the entirely wrong direction....walk the line with the group, thats what its for.  Dont run too far, just enough to avoid the nova (range is small IMO).  Lots of people like to blame the healer or the tank but I've noticed a lot of DPSers are just lazy and want to be carried, I mean, you guys do realize some tanks run recount and can see who is carrying their weight.   You know, all you 10% damage done DPS people out there when you should be pulling around 20-30 like the rest of us?

From that point on it was up to me to bring down all 85% of his HP by myself, she stuck on me like glue (for the most part) and ate one nova during it, we finished with her having ~2000 mana and full hp on both parts.\n\nSince then I am crit capped and about 2k more health. Boss is just as simple in heroic.. I doubt we could duo it, or if we could it would be a long fight, even in normal it took us roughly 6 min to single dps him down, and she had to mana pot once.\n\nTips for those of you who have(nt) read ghostcrawlers \"hey noob\" post about how to do this boss:\n\nWhen he starts channeling Nova he has a sort of pulsing radius around him on the ground, this is roughly the range of the nova.. run just a few feet more and you'll be safe (i'd venture to say it's less than 15yd range). I don't recommend moving too much further than that point. \n\nIf you wish to move further to feel like you're out of range then it's your call, I however like to use the ramp and it's nice \"prelit\" line as a guide when I am running, so the less I run the more space I have to kite him before I have to turn and bring him back to the throne. This also saves time for dps to begin on the boss again.\n\n[i]Mark your tank.[/i]  What this does is gives everyone else that can't pay attention or is caught up in the battle a visual to know where to run, they should already know when by the big emote that flashes in the center of the screen. When the emote flashes, follow the {skull} or whatever, wherever he may go. The tanks position is key to this fight because his \"aoe\" damage starts when melee begins (on his part or the tanks); this [i]should[/i] mean when he reaches the tank.\n\nWhy? well because A) you have to get out of range and B) when Loken hits his nova he starts moving toward the tank and if he reaches the tank and starts to attack before you can reach him, you'll start taking aoe damage, this makes it hard on the healer (especially paladins) and most likely in heroic will result in your death.\n\nThat being said there is [i]no[/i] reason to eat the novas. Unless perhaps to go for the achievement if your dps is undergeared and your healer can handle the aoe.", "date": "2008-12-16T10:49:57-06:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2008-12-16T10:53:02-06:00", 2, "230695"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 69, "id": 536342, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "DKRakiel", "body": "Copy/pasting from my comment on overall HoL part:\r\n\r\nKilling Loken in under 2 minutes is quite possibly; its just a DPS check on the fight. \r\n\r\nSuggested Loken Strategy:\r\nIf you notice on the dais that his throne sits on, theirs two bronze bands that run along the length of the stairs. These are going to be your left/right boundary markers. Due to the fact this fight is based on movement I suggest any movement buffs; I particularly like using DK's with Unholy Auras for this factor - just because theres fifty billions DK's and its a passive speed buff that doesn't give you a daze if your hit. \r\n\r\nLoken himself is rather easy - he is fairly squishy; and he doesn't hit that hard - the reason he's such a pain is his abilities can easily ruin your day:\r\n\r\nDoT Aura: The further you are from Loken the more damage you take. So melee ranged targets take the least damage, but if you get far from him you can quite easily end up being one shotted by the aura DoT. \r\nNegating It: The way you have to get around this is rather simple.. Stay close to him; stay in melee range whether or not your melee preferably. Hunters are only really ones that have any issue with melee range and as long as your within the 5 yards it's really all the same anyways.\r\n\r\nArc-Lightning: This is the reverse of the DoT aura; its fundamentally a chain lightning that is really.. Really.. Really evil. You get hit with arc, and anyone near you gets zapped. And than anyone near them gets the arc bounced off them. For pretty nasty damage. Its not so much an issue in normal as it is in heroic, but its a health concern as it will bounce among your group if your all clustered together. However to be fair, with a solid healer and heavy DPS you can simply eat it and therefore not have to worry about positioning. \r\nNegating It: Arc lightning in my opinion is generally the trickiest to negate - the aura you just have to stay close.. The arc lightning you want to try to have 5 yards on each other. What I normally is form a semi-circle on Loken. For a mental image, assume the tank moves Loken to the left boundary marker, and than turns Loken so he's on it and the tanks back is to the right boundary marker. The group than spreads out on the frontal arc of Loken, no-one behind. This makes it so when they have to run, they all run in the same direction and don't have to cross through Loken.\r\n\r\nNova: This is the culmination of all the abilities, and the main reason why people wipe directly - arc lightning might cause big issues or take down someone or two, but Nova will often or not be the closing statement on any wipe. It was stated you can tell when its coming based on the gathering energy at his feet; 5 coils means nova time - but I've never seen this or tried it. Nova simply will eat you alive if you get hit by it - fortunately its easy to avoid. Sort of. \r\nNegating It: Nova is quite easy to escape - it involves Loken standing still and channeling something. However, you have to watch for it and get out of its range. I run on high graphics so I don't know how applicable this is to everyone - but I assume Blizzard puts essential graphics on a \"must render\" setting. If you look at the ground when Loken starts his Nova, you can see the exact radius it has by the boundaries of the crackling lightning and flashing strikes of lightning. Get out of the animation boundaries, your out of Nova. \r\n\r\nTaking Him Down:\r\nLoken is a spank and tank beyond those three abilities. So what you want to do is to grab him and pull him to the aforementioned left boundary marker - the side doesn't really matter, but just stating one for consistency. Once you pull him there, reface him so your back is to the right boundary marker - your group should already be in a loose semi-circle around him. If you get a Arc Lightning bouncing off someone, give them a bit more room. When he starts to channel his Nova, run back to the right side marker. To be honest; you generally only need to run about half way if Lokens on the left marker, but if your having issues on not wiping its better to be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nOnce Loken finishes his Nova (hopefully sans destroying your group), he will run over to you - reface him so your back is to left boundary and than rinse and repeat. He should die rather easily for you than.\r\n\r\n-Rakiel", "date": "2008-12-29T15:02:22-06:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Once the nova starts to cast everyone should move away from the boss. Example: Tank = south, Healer = SE DPS1 = E DPS2 = W DPS3 = SW. The aura is based on distance to Loken, not distance between every team member, meaning which direction you move is irrelevant, as long as you keep at a safe distance to avoid nova + close enough not to get hit too hard by aura.\r\n3.

After this point its just matter of the tank mitigating dmg and the healer doing the best he can to heal himself and the tank and remaining dps to kill Loken as fast as possible.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 123, "id": 727513, "nreplies": 1, "sticky": 0, "user": "318094", "body": "This fight is absurdly easy to heal through for a priest on Heroic.\r\n\r\nThe first time I came here, I tried the ranged tactic I did on normal to little success. Even if you escape the Lightning Nova, the periodic AoE effect will eat you alive and you cannot properly heal your group if you're constantly worried about yourself. After two wipes, we tried a different tactic. Hug that sucka, which seems to be the preferred approach in the comments regardless.\r\n\r\nThis fight is where Holy Nova SHINES, Discipline OR Holy, and I'm Holy. Everyone stands as close as possible, right under him if you can. The tank tries not to move too much so people don't gain distance from him. The priest spams Holy Nova ALL the time, except for when Circle of Healing and/or Prayer of Mending are off cooldown. Critical heals and damage save lives here (Disc will continually proc Divine Aegis; Holy will continually proc Surge of Llight, which guarantees a free heal to one party member or a free Smite to Loken).\r\n\r\nWhen you get the message that he's casting Lightning Nova, you shield yourself, and time a Prayer of Healing or Divine Hymn to hit right after the blast. Then you get back to the HN spam. If you run out of mana, target Loken and pop your fiend, who will not have much to worry about AoE-wise so you'll get a lot of mana back.\r\n\r\nThere is no priest you can have except for one with weak healing that won't be able to heal through this AND get the Timely Death achievement for you.\r\n\r\nSome observations I've made: Druids and Shamans should be able to heal through this without worry because of their nature resist buffs and/or totems. Holy Pallies should be able to heal through this by systematically healing with Holy Light (glyphed) to keep everyone up. They should probably continually shift the target of their beacon so that they're always healing two people at a time for a lot while everyone else benefits from the little heal that the glyph provides (which should be significant because of Holy Light crits). If someone's life is too low to survive a Nova, I suspect that Divine Intervention will keep them up and they can immediately join the fray after the blast. It really isn't complicated regardless of the healer involved.\r\n\r\nI will say this: Hunters, even if you have to occasionally abandon your shooting range to avoid taking huge damage, it's more prudent to keep as close as possible and maybe just let your pet do the fighting, step out to fire a quick ability, then hop right back in. I think Hunters have the hardest time with Loken because in order to do their dps, they've gotta stand farther away which hurts them more in the long run. After my first time running H HoL with a hunter in our group and seeing him get ripped to shreds from the AoE after a Nova, I give hunters that very warning. Stay close even if you have to abandon your dps to do it.\r\n\r\nBut yeah. This is the definition of tank n' spank otherwise.
