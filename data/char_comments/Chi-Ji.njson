Snails are critters.[/li]\n[li]Chi-Chi is a flying pet and takes extra magic damage. Snails have a magic attack.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nWhether you have a [npc=64352], [npc=62313], [npc=62246], [npc=63001] or [npc=51635] does not matter, they all have the same abilities.\n\nMaintain the [petability=369] debuff at all times and spam [petability=445]. \nUse [petability=564] during the third round when Chi-Chi goes [petability=998]. Since Chi-Chi uses that ability on cooldown thereafter, you will not be able to use Dive each time, but each time you use it during her Ethereal, you save yourself about 500 health from the subsequent quills. Definitely do that.\n\nI killed Chi-Chi with two snails, and had an [npc=68819] as a backup in case Chi-Chi needed to be finished, but he did not see combat.\n\nNote that I tried using [petability=310] instead of [petability=369], and got my behind handed to me. It is really important to maintain that debuff.\n\n\nEDIT: if your two snails can't finish off Chi-Chi (it can happen with some bad rng), use an arcane eye to do the job:\nuse [petability=475] on the first round, one time is enough to give you the initiative. Use [petability=474] for a free round and either [petability=473] or [petability=483] thereafter. You should not need to use that third ability more than once or twice. [npc=68662] would also be a great \"finisher\" with [petability=362] and [petability=593]. just don't throw your surge if Chi-Chi's [petability=998] is off cooldown.\n\nThe combat rotation I now follow is this:\n[table border=1 width =50%]\n[tr][td width=10%]Round[/td][td width=35%] Ch-Chi[/td][td width=55%]My Pet[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]1[/td][td]Tranquility[/td][td]Pass[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]2[/td][td]Fire Quills[/td][td]Acidic Goo[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]3[/td][td]Ethereal[/td][td]Dive, part 1[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]4[/td][td]Fire Quills[/td][td]Dive, part 2 (quills miss)[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]5[/td][td]Fire Quills[/td][td]Ooze touch[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]6[/td][td]Fire Quills[/td][td]Acidic Goo[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]7[/td][td]Ethereal[/td][td]Swap to Snail #2[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]8[/td][td]Fire Quills[/td][td]Ooze touch[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]9[/td][td]Fire Quills[/td][td]Ooze touch[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]10[/td][td]Fire Quills[/td][td]Ooze touch (dead Chi-Chi)[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\nThe fight might last longer if you miss a dive or Chi-Chi decides to pop tranquility in round 10, but you have Dive available at round 11 for his next ethereal and your trusty Darkmoon/Arcane eye if things go south.

I tried many other battle pet teams suggested here. Chi-chi decimated my pet stable. So, like others have done before me, I started throwing everything I had left at her without much rhyme or reason behind it, hoping against hope to finish the Celestial Tournament after spending hours trying to wring the neck of this last stubborn bird. Whether the strat I'm about to present will work ever again for anyone else is questionable but I did finally kill Chi-Chi. Here is how I did it.\n\nMy team consisted of:\n\n[url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=90202/abyssius]Abyssius[/url] \n[url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365/terrible-turnip]Terrible Turnip[/url] \n[url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=86067/widget-the-departed]Widget the Departed[/url]\n\nI started with Abyssius and cast Volcano followed by Flamethrower. \nChi-Chi went Ethereal and I switched to the Terrible Turnip.\nTerrible Turnip cast Sunlight followed by Leech Seed, then Weakening Blow until Chi-Chi killed him.\nI brought Abyssius back in, cast Volcano again, maybe Flamethrower once more before he died.\nNow it was all up to Widget.\nWidget cast Call Darkness followed by Spectral Strike, then Pounce until either Call Darkness or Spectral Strike was ready again.\nI just cast whatever was ready not really trying to dodge attacks or make the most of Ethereal. \nWidget hung in there, dodging several attacks, resurrecting after dying, and was the last cat standing.\n\nSo, it's a sloppy strat, an \"I'm at the end of my wits\" strat, a \"throw everything but the kitchen sink at that bird\" strat, but it did work for me. Maybe someone can fine tune it into something reliable for when the snails fail.", "date": "2017-03-05T23:44:16-06:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Did the trick for me", "creationdate": "2017-05-09T13:26:31-05:00", "id": 1050453, "rating": 1, "commentid": 2475783, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Gendi", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2017-03-06T11:37:02-06:00", 1, "maricam58"]}

The one great thing that Isle of Time / Patch (Who knows which) did is to make it possible for players not in a group to share in the loot from killing a rare elite or a boss. This was expanded to include Moonfang, possibly the best thing to ever happen to Darkmoon. It transcends Alliance / Horde, which I think is seriously cool. Forgive me for being a child at heart.\n\nBut...not always. For reasons that I have never been able to get an answer to, from anyone (because nobody knows?) ranging from experienced players on both sides to the two GMs I spoke with (both of whom ducked the question very politely), sometimes the old rules apply. Meaning if you're not in a group or not of the same faction (Horde / Alliance), you might jump into a fight, kill Big Bird (i.e. Chi-Ji), max out on the DPS scale and win a grand total of...nothing. Sorry, you do get to pay 50+ in gold for repairs.\n\nIt seems to be random, at least in my case. At least twice, I have been triumphantly at the top of the DPS scale and (in one case) gotten the best pair of pants I own (in Azeroth). A thrilling prize - one of the best I've gotten since the beginning. Nine days later, same fight, same Big Bird, same circumstances, same (just go to the replay) whatever: nothing except a big repair bill.\n\nDo I care? Enough to warn you. It's clear that the rewards have a random element. Many times you'll get great loot but sometimes you will only get a really-big repair bill. Can everyone participate cross-faction? Sure but no guarantees. Never any guarantees. This might not be true if you're in a group; I'm only talking about independent players.\n\nJust like real life. I can live with that.
