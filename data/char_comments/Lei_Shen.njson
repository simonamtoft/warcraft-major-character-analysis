A popular idea was for him to need to pause and recharge periodically, but someone suggested an interesting twist on that idea\u2014the Thunder King isn\u2019t just a battery that needs to recharge; he\u2019s actually a power source himself. So instead of him drawing power from his citadel, the citadel draws power from him. He is a mighty warrior in his own right, with distinctive weapon and lightning attacks, but his mere presence energizes and activates portions of his citadel\u2019s defenses, and managing those becomes a central element of the encounter. With a wide array of incredible visuals provided by our effects artists, and an awesome dungeon backdrop (those walls aren\u2019t entirely decorative . . .), Lei Shen is an epic final encounter to wrap up an epic raid zone.[/i]\r\n\r\n[url=http://us.battle.net//wow/en/blog/8778639]Official Blizzard article[/url]", "date": "2013-02-27T07:13:35-06:00", "rating": 36, "indent": 0, "roles": 6408, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

He was the first emperor of the Mogu, and he's actually based off the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. Qin was also a bit of a tyrant, he conquered many lands, and was a full time dictator. He conquered all of the separated states of china and unified them under one banner. (Like Lei Shen did to all the races of Pandaria) Qin ordered his army of slaves to do anything and everything for him, and would constantly enslave more and more people to do his bidding. One massive work order he bestowed upon his slaves was actually to create a huge wall to block off barbarian invaders from china, and this wall would later become the Great Wall of China. Sound familiar? Lei Shen constructed the Serpents spine wall for the same purpose, except instead of keeping out barbarians, it was to keep out the Mantid. Finally, even though MANY people tried to assassinate Qin, they all failed due to the Emperor's strength and cunning, and in the end, Qin died a natural death of old age, once again, just like Lei Shen. \r\n\r\nThis is a really cool historical reference by blizzard and it makes me even more excited to face him in the upcoming weeks! :D", "date": "2013-03-05T23:46:46-06:00", "rating": 174, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "the terracotta army are also commissioned by Qin Shi Huang as part of his funerary art, and that's why the a lot of questlines in pandaria involve mogu statues coming to life and whatnot.", "creationdate": "2013-03-22T02:01:55-05:00", "id": 644343, "rating": 16, "commentid": 1821983, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "qroxfire", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Oh my god, qroxfire!

He unified the mogu races into one giant clan rather than many divided clans and through his will many of Pandaria's most notable works of ancient architecture were created, including the Serpent's Shine, Mogu'shan Palace and the two shrines either side of it in the Vale. He also lay the foundations for a dynasty of Mogu emperors, ruling an empire of slaves.\n\nThe mogu are a power-hungry race whose history is written in the blood of their enemies. In the past, warring clans and kingdoms fought for dominion over parcels of land, each looking to gain the upper hand against their neighbors. That all changed when Lei Shen leveraged his power and cunning to became the greatest of the mogu. Born during the Age of a Hundred Kings, Lei Shen was the son of a warlord and possessed a strength that commanded respect from the other mogu. He went on to do what many thought impossible; he united the mogu kings beneath him and declared himself emperor.\n\nOnce united, the mogu swept across Pandaria, conquering and subjugating all of the other races\u2014until he encountered the mantid. The Lorewalkers were diligent in chronicling the history of Pandaria and have this text on record:\n\n[quote][i]'It has been written that when the great Lei Shen first looked upon the lands of the mantid, he did not feel fear, but inspiration.\n\nAs he began to unify his people under a single banner and subjugate the other races of Pandaria, he knew that the mantid would never succumb to his authority. They spoke his language, the language of strength. He commanded his slaves to construct the Serpent's Spine, a magnificent wall that spanned the length of the empire.\n\nIt would take many generations to build. But Lei Shen knew how to motivate his subjects. Fear. Fear of the mantid moved mountains, raised armies, secured his empire, and built his wall.'[/i][/quote]\n\nHe is rumoured to have died of natural causes, as during his time, none could stand up to his might. He was taken to a mogu crypt deep within Kun Lai Summit, and entombed. It was and still is a great honor for mogu to be buried intact, as they otherwise treat the corpses of their dead as as parts and reagents for their spells and magic. \n\nHowever, the departure of the mists has prompted the return and rise of the Zandalari trolls, who have brought The Thunder King back to life. It falls to the Alliance and Horde's strength to put him down, as the forces of Pandaria alone are regrettably not enough.\n[quote]\n\n[i]Pandaria, her hills of gold,\nIn dark and mournful times of old,\nDid once a hopeless horror hold.\nWhen from her sacred Vale did spring,\nWith storm and flash, a monstrous thing,\nHis name Lei Shen, the Thunder King.\nHis thunder boomed across the land,\nAnd none who dared and fought could stand\nAgainst the iron tyrant\u2019s hand.\nA palace grand, a walled domain,\nSuch mighty works born of his reign.\nBuilt by slaves, their hearts in chains,\nBut seasons change and tyrants die,\nHis fury spent in times gone by,\nThe thunder slept beneath Kun-Lai.\nBy Zandalari hands he has been taken,\nBy Zandalari voice he has awakened.\nGather heroes, sound the drums,\nThe Thunder King comes...\n[b]The Thunder King comes.[/b]\n[/i][/quote]\n\n[b]But most importantly of all, [u]he is voiced by the one-and-only Christopher Lee[/u] - though you might know him better as Sauron the White, from The Lord of the Rings films.[/b]", "date": "2013-03-06T19:00:29-06:00", "rating": 61, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "The voice actor is actually Paul Nakauchi, check imdb", "creationdate": "2014-11-16T16:11:32-06:00", "id": 790862, "rating": 7, "commentid": 1823064, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Naszamax", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Naszamax is correct.

In particular, Static Shock and Bouncing Bolts are especially terrible to deal with once they are level 3, since these two are also the worst abilities.  However, in order to disable a conduit, it is necessary for it to have the highest charge.\n\nThe trick here is to charge the designated pillar to as close to 100 power as possible but without letting it reach level 2.  Then, all the other pillars are to be charged to a power that is strictly lower than the designated pillar (staying at level 1, of course).  This way, during intermission phase, all abilities are at level 2 (which is as low the mechanics allow) and the designated pillar will be disabled after the intermission.\n\nThis does imply that phase 1 is a somewhat of a DPS check since the raid would have at most ~3 mins before there are no more pillars to charge without ruining this strategy.  Some extra time can be bought by having the raid eat some extra damage from Discharged Energy (during which Lei Shen is not charging anything), if needed.\n\n\n[u][b]How the conduit mechanic works[/b][/u]\n\nThere are 4 conduits in each cardinal direction, each of which can grant a special ability to Lei Shen (exactly how this occurs will be mentioned later in this post):\n[ul]\n[li](North) [spell=135695]: AoE damage that is split among players.[/li]\n[li](East) [spell=135991]: Chain lightning that spawns an add for each player that gets hit.[/li]\n[li](South) [spell=136295]: Causes a ring of energy to radiate from that player (max radius: about half the room).  Players standing at the direct center are unaffected.  In addition, it's sometimes possible to jump over the ring to avoid the effect.[/li]\n[li](West) [spell=135683]: Several bolts are launched and land after a few secs (indicated by blue, swirling ground animations).  If no players catch a bolt, an add will spawn and the bolt will bounce and land elsewhere ([i]ad infinitum[/i], until the bolt gets soaked by a player).[/li]\n[/ul]\nEach conduit has two properties (they are displayed in the boss frames):\n[ul]\n[li][b]level[/b]: either 1, 2 or 3[/li]\n[li][b]power[/b]: from 0 to 100[/li].\n[/ul]\nAll conduits begin at level 1 and power 0.  When Lei Shen is in close proximity to a conduit (the range is quite small), he will [b]charge[/b] the conduit, increasing the power of the conduit at a rate of about 2.3 per sec.  While charging, the power of this conduit is displayed in the alternate power bar.  Once the power reaches the maximum (100), the conduit will gain a level and the power resets to zero.  If the level is at its maximum (3), the power will remain at 0 and Lei Shen will stop charging the conduit and begin to release [spell=134820] until he is moved to another (uncharged) conduit.\n\nIn phases 1 and 2, Lei Shen will gain the ability of the conduit that he is currently charging.  In the intermission phases, Lei Shen will gain the ability of all the conduits (except the one that gets disabled).\n\n[i]Both[/i] the power and level of a conduit will affect the damage of the corresponding ability.  However, the level will also cause the ability to be more powerful in a different way:\n[ul]\n[li][spell=135695]: More players are afflicted with the debuff; 1 per level (e.g. at level 3 there will be 3 Static Charge debuffs going out).[/li]\n[li][spell=135991]: The adds have more health and hit harder (not usually of concern).[/li]\n[li][spell=136295]: More rings will spawn; 10-player: 1 per level / 25-player: 2 (?) per level.[/li]\n[li][spell=135683]: More bolts will spawn; 10-player: 3 per level / 25-player: 8 per level.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nWhen the an intermission phase occurs, all conduits will automatically gain 1 level (assuming they are not already capped at 3), but their power remains unchanged.  Once the intermission ends, every conduit will reset to level 1 and power 0, and the conduit with the highest [i]effective[/i] level ( = level \u00d7 100 + power) will be disabled for the rest of the encounter.", "date": "2013-03-23T03:23:25-05:00", "rating": 47, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "A small note, it is possible to have a conduit at 100 charge but not leveled up, even at level 1.

Once the raid gets the hang of the mechanics, the fight is fairly straightforward (if high damage and long.)\n\n[b]Entire Raid[/b]:\n This guy has a whole bunch of abilities, but with DBM and common sense they won't cause you much trouble.  However, there are four mechanics in this fight that are particularly important to note.  Once you get them down, you've got the fight done and it's just a matter of staying alive long enough to kill the boss. \n\n1. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=136295]Overcharged[/url] - If someone near you gets Overcharged, they will grow to twice their normal size and get a lightning pool around their feet.  You have two options - A) Stack right on top of them and avoid the effect or B) Get as far away as possible (40 yards at least) and avoid the effect.  If you are closer, you'll take large amounts of damage and get stunned.\n\n2. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=135695]Static Shock[/url] - The affected player gets a blue arrow over his or her head and an 8 yard circle around the feet.  After 8 seconds they explode doing a bunch of damage, shared by everyone in the circle.  Stack on people with blue arrows (and for goodness sake don't run away if you've got the arrow...)\n\n3. Bouncing Bolt ([url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=69013]Diffused Lightning[/url] adds) - The boss throws a bolt of lightning that bounces across the platform.  Its landing site is denoted by a small, blue swirly circle. Someone has to stand in the circle and get hit by the lightning bolt when it bounces through.  If this does not happen, an add spawns.  During the intermission, dozens of adds can spawn in just a few seconds if people don't follow this mechanic.  (Note: This is different from the large, whitish swirly circle from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=135095]Thunderstruck[/url].)\n\n4. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=135991]Diffusion Chain[/url] - A chain lightning type ability that causes an annoying add to spawn for every single person hit.  Spread out to avoid the effect.\n\n[u]Tanks[/u]:\nTank the boss near a pillar.  Each pillar provides the boss with a special power, and the level of the pillar can be seen by counting the rings of lightning it has.  When the pillar reaches three levels (three rings of lightning) it becomes supercharged and more dangerous (though not deadly in LFR.)  Move the boss from pillar to pillar to prevent any of them from charging completely.  After the intermissions, pieces of the platform become electrified and should be avoided.\n\n- We chose Bouncing Bolt to start with so that we could eliminate the adds after the first intermission, but your raid may prefer a different pillar.  \n\nDuring the first phase, swap after each [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=134916]Decapitate[/url], and the tank who is focused for Decapitate should run away (the ability does less damage the farther you move, but you really don't have to go far on LFR.)\n\nAfter the first phase the fight becomes a single tank fight.  There is an intended tank swap later but it is unnecessary in LFR.  It's much easier for the tanks to stick to boss or adds rather than trying to swap (there may or may not even be adds to deal with.)\n\nThroughout the fight the adds should be gathered up so that they can be AoE'ed down, preferably on top of the boss.\n\n[u]DPS[/u]:\nKill adds whenever possible.  When the boss casts Thunderstruck, get away from the large swirly mark on the ground.  Follow the mechanics for the four abilities that I noted above. (Stack on Overcharged or Static Shock, stand in small blue puddles to prevent adds, and spread out for diffusion chain.)  During intermission, spread out around the platform and continue following those mechanics.  \n\n[u]Healers[/u]:\nThere is a lot of tank damage, particularly when the boss is being moved between pillars.  Raid damage is also substantial, but it came in bursts that looked worse than they actually were.  During intermission, try to spread out around the platform so that each quarter has someone healing.  Be sure to follow the mechanics that I noted above (particularly during the intermission, when they will all happen in turn.)  There is a pushback phase near the end of the fight.  As long as you don't run against the pushback, you can cast while sliding backward.\n\n[b]tl;dr version[/b]:\nThere are four abilities that you have to pay attention to or the raid will wipe.\n1. Overcharged - Stack on the giant person who is affected and it won't hurt you.  If two people are overcharged near each other, pick one (you'll still get hit by the other, but won't die.)\n\n2. Static shock - Stack on the person with the blue arrow to share damage.\n\n3. Bouncing Bolt - Stand on the small, blue, swirly puddles to keep adds from spawning.\n\n4. Diffusion chain - Spread out to avoid chain lightning/adds.\n\n[u]Tanks[/u]:\nTank the boss near a pillar until the progress bar gets close to full then move it to a different corner.  Swap after Decapitate and run away if you were the Decapitate target.  Pick up adds.  After phase 1 it's pretty much a single tank fight in LFR, or boss tank/add tank anyway.  Avoid the electrified quarter of the platform after phase 1 and 2.\n\n[u]DPS[/u]:\nFollow the mechanics listed above.  Adds > Boss.  When Thunderstruck happens (large swirly lightning circle) get away.  During intermission spread out on the platform but continue following the mechanics.\n\n[u]Healers[/u]:\nLots of damage all around, with high tank damage when moving between corners.  Be sure to follow the mechanics listed above.  Spread out during intermission so that the entire raid is getting healed.\n\n[b]Macroable version[/b]:\n[code]\n/instance Overcharged-Stack on player. Static Shock-Stack on blue arrow.\n/instance Bouncing Bolt-Stand in blue puddles.  Diffusion chain-Spread out.\n/instance Tank by a pillar, don't let bar fill. Swap after Decapitate.

This fight is all about positioning and adds. \r\n\r\nZoom out the camera as far as it possibly can. Once you land in the arena, position yourself in the dead center, pick a pillar and make both your character and your camera angle face it. This pillar will be your focal point that will save you during Helm of Command. Do not move the camera angle, do not move yourself, do not face any direction other than the pillar. If you get moved by a mechanic or the angle changes with Lei Shen's movements, reclaim that spot as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nSend your pet to attack Lei Shen, but avoid doing damage yourself. You'll be out of range for Mend Pet, so duck in closer every now and then, but just focus on avoiding stuff and killing adds. The goal is to stay in the middle and reduce any damage Lei Shen can do to you before his adds show up to hurt. \r\n\r\nWhen he casts Helm of Command, which is a light blue beam that latches onto you and pushes you away, run forwards towards him - still facing the pillar you picked before. Do nothing but run forwards.

Either before or after Iron Qon, the difficulty AUTOMATICALLY changed from Heroic to Normal.  You must change it back to Heroic & leave the instance, and re-enter, in order to face Lei Shen and Ra-Den.\n\nFirst attempt:  I went into ToT on one toon this morning, I set it to Heroic 25-man (solo as 120 of course) and entered.  When I defeated Lei Shen, I received no cutscene and couldn't fight Ra-Den.  I checked the difficulty and it was set to Normal.  This pissed me off as I knew I set it to Heroic before entering.\n\nSecond attempt:  I went in a second time on another 120 toon, made damn sure I was set to heroic 25-man.  Right before I faced Lei Shen I checked difficulty and again it was set to Normal.  So I changed it to Heroic, the prompt came up to \"accept\" being in an instance in progress, which I accepted of course.  I continued to Lei Shen to find out that he wasn't there!  Nothing.  Just an empty platform.  \n\nThird attempt:  Third alt... same situation, but I constantly checked the difficulty because I knew it changed at some point.  It seemed to changed after defeating Iron Qon to Normal.  so I immediately changed it back and continued to Lei Shen, who of course WASN'T THERE AGAIN.  \n\nFourth attempt:  Finally got it done... I did the same steps as above, but after defeating Iron Qon, I changed difficulty from normal to heroic and I left the raid completely (porting back with toy), and then ran back to instance and ran all the way back to where I was, and Lei Shen was there!  After beating him the cutscene happened and I was able to fight Ra-Den.\n\nSO!...  If you want to complete the instance and beat Ra-Den:  After defeating Iron Qon you have to leave the dungeon and change it difficulty back to heroic, and then go back in and finish Lei Shen and Ra-Den.
