I'm outnumbered in my own city!\n\n<Jaina's eyes flash mischievously.>\n\nLet's go about this a different way. Put yourself in my shoes. Imagine that YOU are the leader of the Kirin Tor. <name>! The most influential archmage in all of Azeroth!\n\nWhat would YOU do?\n------------------\n[ins]<REPLY>[/ins]I would commit our order to an Alliance victory!

[ins]<go to [5]>[/ins]\n\n\n[ins]------------[2]------------------------[/ins]\nSpoken like a stalwart Alliance <class>! Believe me, I understand the sentiment.\n\nNow then, as leader of the Kirin Tor and a faithful part of the Alliance, what would you do about the Sunreavers? True, they are advocates of the Horde. But they have been allies and productive members of the Kirin Tor for over 2000 years. This city is their home.\n\nWould you expel them?\n------------------\n[ins]<REPLY>[/ins]Yes. Horde is Horde.       [ins]<go to [3]>[/ins]\n------------------\n[ins]<REPLY>[/ins]Not if they renounced the Horde.        [ins]<go to [4]>[/ins]\n\n\n[ins]------------[3]------------------------[/ins]\n<Jaina's eyes grow sad.>\n\nSo... you would purge the city? Cast the Sunreavers from their homes? The very same Sunreavers who helped humans discover magic in the first place?\n\nYou and I are obviously very different. I suppose I see my role - and the mission of the Kirin Tor - a little differently. My mind is set. Would you like to hear what I think?\n------------------\n[ins]<REPLY>[/ins]What do you think?

As the article says, you need to have killed Jaina at least once before to unlock the skip, but fails to mention that [b]only one person needs to have defeated Jaina[/b] is enough to bring everyone in, including people who never stepped foot in the raid before. The skip unlocks account-wide as well, so you can skip with your alts to give you extra chances at the mount.\n\nAfter trying to get this mount myself, I've found out about the [b]cheese/no interrupt strategy[/b]. Whether you're in pug or a guild group, this is worth checking out:\n\n[b]Before you pull the boss[/b]\n\n[ol]\n[li]Mark one range DPS and one melee DPS/tank. Make sure ranged stay grouped together for the first phase and then everyone should move in as a group during the intermission. You need to be stacked with at least 5 other people at all time due to [spell=289379], with the exception of people running out with [spell=287585]. If you're pugging, it is ideal to grab at least 8+ melee DPS/tanks and/or 8+ ranged DPS/healers so that people don't get frozen. You can also assign some ranged to stack on boss if you don't have a lot of melee DPS.[/li]\n[li]Ask people to take off their interrupt spell off their bar. This isn't required, but may avoid a silly wipe where someone interrupts the boss by accident. If you have a protection paladin in your group, [spell=31935] will also interrupt so make sure your tank [b]does not[/b] use this spell on Jaina (or at all) during the intermission.[/li]\n[li]You need a fairly good amount of DPS for this strat to work, especially in pug groups where most people don't know the mechanics. If you're pugging, having 460ilvl or higher is a safe bet for this fight, but you can go lower. Ideally you can push the boss fast enough to skip the first [spell=290036]. [b]Do not cast Bloodlust/Heroism or similar spells in the 1st phase[/b]. This will make Jaina uses Ice Block like any good mage would do to avoid dying, making her immune to any damage for 20 seconds. [b]However[/b], there's [i]yet another[/i] cheese alternative where a leatherworker can use their Tool of the Trade, [item=164978], which [b]won't trigger[/b] Jaina's Ice Block, which is worth using in the 1st phase if you need extra DPS.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[b]Phase one: Burning Seas (boat phase)[/b]\n\n[ol]\n[li]Run out of the group with [spell=287585], then quickly stack up with your group so you don't get frozen.[/li]\n[li]Avoid getting hit by [spell=285828] and [spell=285177] by moving as a group and avoid walking on the [spell=287365].[/li]\n[li]Ranged should be breaking people out of ice blocks if they see any. [/li]\n[li]When the boss is getting near 60%, everyone should stack up. [/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[b]Intermission: Howling Winds (blizzard phase)[/b]\n\n[ol]\n[li]Everyone should be stacked due to [spell=289379]. Before you jump off the ship, make sure you break people out of ice blocks and res anyone if needed. Then everyone jump down the ship together.[/li]\n[li]As you're walking down the ice platform, try to hug the left side of the wall and follow the marked people in your group. Don't hesitate to slow down to avoid leaving anyone behind, you don't need to quickly reach the boss anyway.[/li]\n[li]If you start having high stacks of [spell=285212] (>15), intentionally hit the [spell=288325] that run by your group to get frozen, which will drop your stacks (isn't necessary if you have good healers).[/li]\n[li]Keep hugging the left wall, killing the [npc=149535]s on the way, until you reach Jaina.[/li]\n[/ol]\nAt this point, if your group was fast, Jaina will be uninterruptible, and she will have [spell=282841]. Melee can start stacking on the boss and ranged should be right behind them. Melee will get hit by most of the [spell=288325] that come off the boss and ranged will have to cleave the Ice Blocks down. Hold off DPS CDs until the boss becomes interruptible. [b]DO NOT INTERRUPT THE BOSS[/b], or the strat will fail. From there, Jaina has no more shield and you can DPS her down. You can safely cast Bloodlust/Hero (if you didn't use the LW Mallet) and the boss won't Ice Block (if she does, that means someone kicked her). You won't have to deal with the last two phases and the second intermission with this strategy, making the fight nearly trivial to complete.\n\nWorth noting that Legion had an old system for the [item=137575] and [item=152789] mounts, where it used to be 5% drop chance per person in the group, up to 100% drop chance for 1 person with a full 20man group. [b]However[/b], after doing 4-5 kills with around 15 people (or less) in my group, Jaina [b]always[/b] dropped two mounts, prioritizing people who didn't already had it. Based from my own personal experience, I'd say it's a safe bet to bring less than 20 if your guild can avoid pugging, or if you want to increase your chance at getting the mount (if you can still have enough DPS to push the boss fast enough), but there's still no official post that confirms whether or not that system is still in place. And as usual, the drop chance of the mount will be lowered to around 1% when the expansion is over, like how it used to be for Legion and WoD's Mythic raid mounts.\n\nGood luck!", "date": "2020-06-17T11:38:09-05:00", "rating": 15, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I made a video using Hyrcyne's strat, you can see it here: https://youtu.be/GkYgbIaqvQY", "creationdate": "2020-06-18T02:10:33-05:00", "id": 1375172, "rating": 1, "commentid": 3212953, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "pokakap", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Just used this, it totally works and is ridiculously funny to watch.", "creationdate": "2020-06-18T23:26:43-05:00", "id": 1375288, "rating": 0, "commentid": 3212953, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "GreySage", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2020-08-24T01:57:54-05:00", 2, "Hyrcyne"]}

Magni, you have called this meeting.  What concerns you?[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45666]King Magni Bronzebeard[/url]: You've no doubt noticed the string of earthquakes we've had in the last weeks.  Something doesn't feel right about them.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41710]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/url]: What do you mean?[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: We dwarves have a connection to the earth.  We can feel her pain.  And right now the earth is crying out.  These earthquakes... they are both natural and not.  I wanted to gather you all together and discuss them.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45776]Tyrande Whisperwind[/url]: Even in Darnassus we have noticed the earth is at odds with something.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: I've received word from my brother Brann in Northrend.  In his exploring of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/zone=4273]Ulduar[/url] he came across some unusual tablets... something ancient.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Nothing good has come from that dreadful place.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: This might just change your mind.  Brann is shipping the tablets to me as we speak. Preliminary reports from the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Explorers'_League]Explorers' League[/url] state that they may be able to help us understand what is going on with the earthquakes.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45667]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/url]: Our top minds have been looking into the seismic activities... Well, we've mostly been looking at how to secure a building's frame while at the same time simulating tectonic shifts...[/li]\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: ...because on the one hand, this could be a handy device, the \"Shake-a-Ton 2000.\"  But on the other hand, the last thing we gnomes want to see is the mountains of Dun Morogh collapse and crush Ironforge.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: So is that why you have moved out?[/li]\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: Ha, not at all!  Though it is a striking coincidence.  Gnomeregan has been and continues to shame our people.  It is long past time we reclaim our homeland.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Well, it is good that things have turned out... better for you and your people, High Tinker.  But not all of us have the luxury of up and moving our kingdom.[/li]\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45774]Prophet Velen[/url]: And those that did know how dangerous these earthquakes can be.  To this day, the Exodar is still shaking from our rather abrupt arrival.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I'm not certain we could organize our people to move even if we wanted to.  We've also received word of hostile elementals appearing randomly across the lands, sometimes in towns, sometimes across the countryside.  Moving may not be an option.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: Well, there is at least a wee bit of good news... no offense, Gelbin.  The shaking seems to have stirred up [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Earthen_Ring]The Earthen Ring[/url].  Even the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=39055]Wildhammer shaman[/url] have offered their help.[/li]\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Perhaps these events are also what have brought forth the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Highborne]Highborne[/url] from [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Shen%27dralar]Shen'dralar[/url].[/li]\n[li][b]Prophet Velen[/b]: It seems as if this world is coming apart at the seams.  I've seen these symptoms before, on Draenor... We may not be able to stop this.  Fleeing may be our best option.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Fleeing is not an option I wish to entertain at this point. We will find another way.  Perhaps these tablets from Ulduar will shed some light on our situation.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: Hopefully we can get these answers quickly.  The [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40125]people[/url] are frightened, and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40124]cultists[/url] are taking advantage of that fear.[/li]\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: These cultists only exacerbate the problem.  They preach the end of the world, or that the world is having birthing pains... Hyperbole that is hard for the populace to ignore.[/li]\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Troubling times indeed. Fear of the unknown makes people do foolish things.[/li]\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: And our lack of answers only fuels the confusion.[/li]\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: All the more reason we need to reach the bottom of this.  This tablet from Ulduar will lead us in the right direction.  Brann is sure of it.  And if Brann is certain, then I am certain.[/li]\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I've made it a point not to argue with a dwarf when it comes to the earth.  If the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Bronzebeard_clan]Bronzebeards[/url] are sure this tablet will help solve the earth's problems, then by all means we should support them.[/li]\n[/ul][/quote]", "date": "2010-11-01T20:28:20-05:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-11-01T20:44:49-05:00", 1, "Ketho"]}
