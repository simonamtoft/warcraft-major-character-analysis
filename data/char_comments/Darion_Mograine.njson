The boy cried out, his shocked, betrayed, anguished cry--that of the wind raging outside--and for a moment Arthas saw him standing there, the blade buried in his chest almost as big as he was, and felt one final tremor of remorse as he met his own eyes.\nThen the boy was gone.[/quote]\n\n[quote]\"Yes!\" the orc exhilarated, laughing almost maniacally. \"I knew you would make this choice.

He slipped his other arm around the body, pressing his lips so close to the green ear that the gesture was almost intimate, as intimate as the act of taking a life always was and always would be.\n\"No,\" Arthas whispered. \"No [i]we[/i]. No one tells me what to do. I've got everything I need from you--now the power is mine and mine alone. Now there is only I. I am the Lich King.

Here is a summary, some parts may be inaccurate because I don't have the comic with me to check and am going by memory:\r\n\r\nDarion was born in Brill to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=29227]Alexandros Mograine[/url] and his wife Elena. Elena died in childbirth, and Darion wasn't breathing when he was born. Horrified, Alexandros rushed the infant Darion to a nearby river and got him to breathe by nearly drowning him. Alexandros was very protective of Darion growing up, which made Darion's older brother [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=3976]Renault[/url] jealous.\r\n\r\nAfter the plague of undeath destroyed Lordaeron, Alexandros and his friend [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=4542]Fairbanks[/url] traveled south to Ironforge and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=2784]Magni Bronzebeard[/url]. Magni forged a sword from a stone that Alexandros found at the Battle of Blackrock Spire years ago. He filled the sword with his hatred for [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=27455]Arthas[/url] since the paladin killed his brother, [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=27480]Muradin[/url]. The sword was the mighty [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=13262]Ashbringer[/url].\r\n\r\nThe remaining Knights of the Silver Hand, including the Mograine family, were working together from an abandoned monastery in the Tirisfal Glades. However, one of their number was possessed by the demon [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=10813]Balnazzar[/url]. Balnazzar manipulated the others into being radicals who saw any and all non-humans as undead monsters. There were some who left the group then, sickened by their racism. Balnazzar also manipulated Renault using the young man's resentment towards Darion and Alexandros.\r\n\r\nRenault convinced Alexandros and Fairbanks to attack the burning city of Stratholme, but they were ambushed by the undead. Renault watched them die, telling his father that he never wanted to be like him. Renault returned to the monastery, but it turned out that Fairbanks survived. He accused Renault of what he had done, but the disguised Balnazzar convinced the others that Fairbanks was insane and had contracted the plague. He was killed and hidden in a secret chamber of the monastery. Meanwhile, Alexandros's corpse was gathered up and brought to Naxxramas. The lich [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=15990]Kel'thuzad[/url] raised him into undeath. While this was happening, the Silver Hand knights at the monastery renamed themselves the Scarlet Crusade.\r\n\r\nDarion left the Crusade after his father's death, and ran into the group that had left earlier. They recruited him into their new, multi-racial order, the Argent Dawn. Darion heard rumors that his father was in Naxxramas, and so led the Argent Dawn's attack on the necropolis. He hoped to free Alexandros from the Scourge's grasp, but was forced to kill him. The last memento of his father was the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=22691]Corrupted Ashbringer[/url], which Darion took. Alexandros's spirit within the blade convinced him to go to the Scarlet Monastery.\r\n\r\nAt the Monastery, Darion confronted Renault. During their argument, the spirit of Alexandros manifested itself from the Ashbringer and killed all of the Scarlets, including his own son. Darion was horrified at what his father had become.\r\n\r\nDarion met with the old exiled hermit [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=1855]Tirion Fordring[/url], asking for advice. Tirion proposed that an act of love could save Alexandros's soul, but when Darion asked him to come with him, Tirion refused. Before Darion left, he told Tirion that he used to be a hero, and could be one again.\r\n\r\nDarion returned to the Argent Dawn's base at Light's Hope Chapel, where the Dawn was surprised to see he survived Naxxramas. At that moment, an army of Scourge led by Kel'thuzad attacked the chapel. During the fighting, Darion realized just what Tirion had meant.\r\n\r\n\"An act of love... my soul for yours. [i]I love you, Dad[/i].\"\r\n\r\nDarion stabbed himself with the Ashbringer, releasing an explosion of light that killed all the attacking undead save Kel'thuzad. This successfully freed Alexandros from the Scourge, but converted Darion himself into a death knight. Kel'thuzad was impressed, and recruited Darion into the Scourge as a suitable replacement.", "date": "2012-06-04T13:52:04-05:00", "rating": 7, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "If magnimade the ashbringer, then why couldn't he make more?", "creationdate": "2015-07-27T18:13:46-05:00", "id": 887862, "rating": 0, "commentid": 1673437, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "biggpeyt", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 9, "id": 708122, "nreplies": 2, "sticky": 0, "user": "Lokann", "body": "You got it all wrong. (This was directed at a deleted post that said Renault killed Darion, Alexandros having given the Ashbringer to his younger son some time before or something like that)\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nRenault and Darion were brothers. Renault killed his own father, Alexandros (also known as the Ashbringer for his sword) and left the blade in the corpse. The murder was orchestrated by Balnazaar and Kel'thuzad. The latter also reclaimed Alexandros's corpse, reanimated it and returned the Ashbringer to him, now a Death Knight in the Lich King's service.\n\nBut Fairbanks, who was with the Ashbringer when he fell and was believed dead, returned and informed the remnants of the Silver Hand of what had really happened. Saiden Dathoran (in reality Balnazaar) deismissed his memories as ramblings and had him \"quarantined\". In the wake of the revelation, the Silver Hand split up into the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn.\n\nDarion, seeking his father, joined the Argent Dawn and gathered a group that would venture into Naxxramas to find the elder Mograine or at least reveal his fate. In the end, they did, as one of the Four Horsemen. Only Darion survived, yet only by killing his father's body, as his brother had done before.\n\nHis father's voice whispered to him from the blade and urged him to bring it to Renault. When he did so, his brother was enraged and tried to kill him and would have succeded if the blade had not released the fettered spirit within to kill the traitor (those who know about what happened if one was to bring the Corrupted Ashbringer into the Scarlet Monastery will find this rather similar to that event). Despairing, Darion vowed to purify his father's vengeful spirit.\n\nTo that end, he contacted Tirion Fordring, who attempted to speak to the spirit, but was appaled and disgusted by what remained of the Light's beacon that was once the Ashbringer. After careful consideration, he informed Darion that only an act of love greater than the act of evil that corrupted the blade could purify it. Darion urged the hermit to join him at Light's Hope to help stop the incoming onslaught of Scourge, but Tirion refused. As Darion prepared to ride away he told Tirion to \"be a hero\", unknowingly echoing the final part of Tirion's letter to his son, Taelan.\n\nAs the Argent Dawn prepared for the inevitable battle, Darion was shown why exactly Light's Hope is so important: beneath it lies a complex of catacombs housing a thousand of the most fervent defenders of Lordaeron who fell to the Scourge and were saved from an eternity of servitude under their nemesis.\n\nThe Scourge's armies by far outnumbered the Argent Dawn, and for each fallen fighter a zombie would rise. Yet they did not lose heart and fought on. In this dark hour, Tirion decided to join in, inspiring the armies. Then, Kel'thuzad himself entered the battlefield and sent a wave of deaspair over almost every warrior on the battlefield. But Darion did not give up and attempted to destroy the lich. Kel'thuzad mocked him and told him not even the Ashbringer could hurt him. Darion finally realised the truth in Tirion's words and understood what the \"act of love\" would have to be. With a final sigh of \"I love you, dad,\" he plunged the Ashbringer into his own heart. With this, he released his father's spirit and also the thousand raging spirits of the Light's champions, who made quick work of the Scourge.\n\nYet in the middle of the destruction, Kel'thuzad stood and spoke to Darion: \"Rise, Darion... Rise, Ashbringer.\" The new Ashbringer sacrifised his life and entered servitude to the Lich King to save his father's soul, which joined the resting spirits beneath Light's Hope, waiting for his son to return so he could return the favor and break the fetters that bound Darion to the Lich King.", "date": "2009-05-07T01:11:43-05:00", "rating": 14, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "The Silver Hand did not split up into the Scarlet Crusade.
