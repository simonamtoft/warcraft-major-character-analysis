He is a friend to the [race=26], who revere him for his example of inner strength, endurance and perseverance. Although Mantid set upon his temple from all sides, he can be found standing atop the stairs overlooking his ruined courtyard, surrounded by his followers. Other days he may be fighting off the Mantid attackers.\n\nSome lore:\n\nWhen [npc=68397], the Thunder King, enslaved the Pandaren many years ago, Niuzao succumbed to fear and doubt, cowering atop a hill as an entire legion of lifelike clay Mogu stood before him. [npc=64528], the white tiger, was shackled as the Thunder King laughed from afar, driving him to roar in unrestrained anger and hatred. [npc=59653], the red crane, flew far and wide to spread hope but was captured, despairing as the Mogu tied him and bound his wings to serve as an example.\n\nThe jade serpent [npc=56762] had encouraged the Pandaren to give up their duties in search of wisdom. Lei Shen was furious. Instead of capturing her like the others, he struck her down from the sky in a flash of lightning, sending her crashing into a forest thicket on the edge of death. In contempt of Pandaren and their unruly qualities, Lei Shen outlawed worship of the Celestials. Even speaking their names was punishable by torture or death.\n\nForgetting the teachings of the celestials didn't just mean being unable to recite old fables and scriptures. Some of the Pandaren feared the Mogu so much that they jumped at every shadow, and lived every day imprisoned inside their own heads. Other Pandaren's thoughts languished in revenge and violence, turning them into bitter, hateful beings. Many of them gave up and accepted their fate with no dreams of a better future, knowing for certain they could only accept slavery or die.\n\nAs it would happen, a group of Pandaren found Yu'lon and bought her to an underground mine where she could safely lie. She blessed them with the wisdom of the celestials, and they built a replica of her out of jade as an act of respect. After a hundred years she drew her last breath, but instead of dying she transferred her essence to the statue, now a symbol of eternal renewal. \"Every end marks a new beginning\", she said.\n\nWith the blessing of Yu'lon's wisdom, Pandaren did not give in after all. The Thunder King passed and the Mogu grew complacent, thinking their dark magic and whips were enough to keep the Pandaren in line. Eventually Kang, the first [class=10], taught his fellow slaves to fight enemies and match the blows of their weapons unarmed, and they rose up to overthrow the Mogu empire, presumably freeing their celestials in the process. The qualities of the Celestials and Kang's fighting technique are hallmarks of Pandaren culture, as seen in the game today.", "date": "2014-10-16T22:18:53-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This comment deserves way more uproots then it has.", "creationdate": "2015-08-25T16:56:24-05:00", "id": 894432, "rating": 1, "commentid": 2014376, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "1Bluemoose", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2014-10-16T22:27:42-05:00", 7, "2picnic"]}
