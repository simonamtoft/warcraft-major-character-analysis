{"commentv2": 1, "number": 1, "id": 1586535, "nreplies": 5, "sticky": 0, "user": "Iroared", "body": "This is the boss for Madness of Deathwing encounter in [zone=5892].\nLoot for this encounter is contained in [object=210079].\n\nStrategy for normal mode (10 man) (updated 12 Jan 2012):\n\n[b]If you know the general mechanics, feel free to skip to the last paragraph with tips and observations[/b]\n\nGroup composition: 1 or 2 tanks (if using a single tank, it either has to be a paladin, or you need pretty good DPS so you don't get two impales), 3 healers (or 2 really good ones).\n\nThe encounter consists of two phases: first phase, which repeats four times, where you defend each aspect's platform, and second phase, where you finish off Deathwing.\n\nFor the first phase, each aspect gives you powerful buffs. Once you are finished defending a platform, you lose the buff from the corresponding aspect. This means you have to figure out which buffs are the most important to your raid and to leave them for later.\nThe buffs are as follows:\n[npc=56099]: increases maximum health by 20%, casts [spell=105565]\n[npc=56102]: increases casting and attack speeds by 20%, casts [spell=105799]\n[npc=56100]: increases healing done by 20%, gives each player the [spell=109634] ability\n[npc=56101]: increases damage done by 20%, causes attacks to occasionally trigger [spell=106043]\nEach platform follows the same pattern. At the start of the fight, and after you are done with one of the first three platforms, Deathwing will cast [spell=107018] - after the cast is completed, he will choose an active platform with the most players to assault. All players should run to that platform.\n\nOn each platform, the goal is to destroy a Deathwing's limb (28M health on 10man normal). When a limb reaches 90%, it starts dealing damage to the raid with [spell=105401], increasing as the limb gets lower on health. At 70% and 40%, [npc=56188]s will spawn around it, which are immune to AoE, and deal rapidly increasing damage to the raid. If Alexstrasza is not active (you already completed her platform), they should be single targeted and killed before the damage becomes unhealable. If Alexstrasza is active, however, she will quickly destroy these herself.\n- Almost immediately after the assault starts, a [npc=56471] will spawn in the back. It casts [spell=109628] at random players, so everyone should stay spread out. It will also cast [spell=106444] at its target, dealing huge damage. The tank needs to use large cooldowns for this. Ideally, the tentacle should die before it casts Impale again, otherwise tanks will need to switch between the impales, and might have problems with defensive cooldowns (each platform usually takes less than 3 minutes). If Ysera is active, [spell=109634] can be used instead. Plan out tank and healer cooldowns beforehand. [i]Note that this is physical damage, and [spell=1022] can be used to immune it, as long as the tank removes it and re-taunts quickly afterwards[/i]\n- At some point Deathwing sends an [spell=105651] at the platform, which flies very fast and deals huge damage on impact high periodic damage until it is destroyed. Nozdormu's [spell=105799] will significantly decrease its travel speed, ideally giving the raid enough time to kill them and avoid the impact (the bolt has about 800k health on 10m normal). If Nozdormu's platform has already been completed, everyone will need to stack far away from the impact point and use raid cooldowns such as [spell=62618] to survive it, and quickly kill the Bolt.\n- Also, several [npc=56263] will spawn, which don't hit hard, but apply [spell=105841] to their target, which eventually overwhelms the tanks. They should be tanked inside timezones to decrease their attack speed. When they reach full energy, they heal to 100%, so DPS should focus on AoE'ing them ([spell=106043] helps out a lot - just spam any aoe spell, Spellweave will do most of the work).\n- Lastly, Deathwing will start casting [spell=106523], which is a one minute cast, and wipes the raid if the limb is not killed in time. At this point, the aspect will cast Focused Assault on the limb, increasing its damage taken by 100%. Killing the limb will remove 20% of Deathwing's health and briefly stun him.\n\nPlatform order depends heavily on group's DPS and healers. If you have great DPS, you can leave Nozdormu last instead of Kalecgos, so you don't have to worry about surviving Elementium bolt impact. If you're doing Ysera early (which most groups start with), you need to plan tank CDs for Impales. Having good dps helps here too, since you might be able to kill the tentacle before the second impale. If you don't do Kalecgos last, it will become much harder to kill Regenerative Blood and subsequently complete the platform before Cataclysm. After red (Alexstrasza), the raid will need to quickly single target Blistering Tentacles, because their damage quickly gets overwhelming.\nKill order on platforms is as follows: start on limb, switch to Corrupton once it spawns. When Elementium Bolt is cast, all DPS must immediately switch to it regardless of whether Corruption is dead or not (it takes a few seconds for the bolt to arrive near the platform). Once the Corruption is dead, DPS should attack the limb, stopping to single-target the Blistering Tentacles and AoE the Regenerative Blood.\n\nOnce all four platforms are cleared, Deathwing will fall forward on Ysera's platform (he will also be attackable from Nozdormu's platform, but everyone needs to assist killing adds on Ysera's). Everyone should quickly get there and start attacking Deathwing's head. There will be two types of adds:\n[npc=56724]: three will spawn in 10m normal; they will cast [spell=109597] at a random player, which will also give them a similar debuff, which shows how much time is left until the cast finishes. Those players need to use [spell=109634] to survive it (it will once again become available in this phase).\n[npc=56710]: two will spawn, they need to be tanked and killed quickly, since they apply [spell=109603], which quickly gets deadly.\nAs Deathwing gets lower on health, he will start dealing increasing damage to the raid, so at some point you will need to ignore the remaining adds and finish the boss.\n\n[b]General tips and observations[/b]\nFor most groups, the easiest order is Green>Red>Yellow>Blue. Make sure big raid cooldowns ([spell=62618], [spell=740], [spell=98008]) are up for the Blue platform, so you can survive the Bolt. You will also need a cooldown or two for the Tentacles when the limb hits 40% on Yellow and Blue platforms, as the raid damage gets very high here.\nPaladin tanks are great here because they can solo-tank all two impales per platform (survive the first with 50% reduction or healer CDs, then use [spell=31850], [spell=1022] or [spell=642] for the second one). Otherwise, you either need two tanks, or one tank and enough DPS to kill the tentacle before second impale, which one-shots the tank. Pop damage cooldowns for the tentacle, since enrage shouldn't be an issue if you're using 1 tank. On phase 2, you have to kill the Terrors very quickly, because one tank will take massive damage from them. It is possible to have a plate DPS tank one Terror for a bit to reduce the stacks on the tank (warriors are best for this). Rogues can also tank one with [spell=5277], using [spell=31224] to remove the stacks, but they can't taunt so don't rely on it. If the tank does die, you can still kill the boss before the second set of Terrors comes out and kills the raid (ignore the Fragments, use Dream for Shrapnel).", "date": "2011-12-01T17:36:58-06:00", "rating": 155, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "As new to wow, and tanking YOU SAVED ME !", "creationdate": "2012-03-17T05:40:04-05:00", "id": 527892, "rating": 17, "commentid": 1586535, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "fountoukaros", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "New to WoW and doing Dragon Soul?

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 5, "id": 1598622, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "ZelosRaine", "body": "This is a challenging fight with both execution requirements, gear checks, and high awareness needed from all raiders. Additionally, it is a very long fight. \r\n\r\nWhat may seem most intimidating about this fight (and what may be holding many guilds back) is the fact that there is no one right order. The general consensus seems to be: begin with Ysera, go to Norzdormu, then either Alexstraza or Kalecgos. The most important thing is to pick one order and stick with it (unless obvious problems immediately emerge).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking (until raid groups' average dps goes up), this will be a 2 tank 2-3 heal fight (on 10 man). My guild (with fairly high raid dps, most averaging 30k+) did 2 tanks, 3 heals. The finer points of our strat are as follows:\r\n\r\nRule of thumb: Kill whatever is newest, use dps cooldowns (generally) on the elementium bolt so that the remainder of the cooldown can be used to finish off the corruption. \r\n\r\nStarting on Ysera's platform, tanks should taunt off after impale with a total of 2 impales per platform. Tanks should use the dream buff to survive impale on this platform. \r\n\r\nOn Norzdormu's, everything is the same except tanks should use their 3 min 50% damage taken cooldowns as the dream buff will be gone.\r\n\r\nOn Alextraza's (we found Kalecgos' damage buff more helpful as the tentacles go down very quickly to good dps), the raid must stack (with the exception of the tank tanking the corruption) as a group as far away from the impact point of the elementium bolt as possible, one raid cooldown (barrier, spirit link, etc) should be used here. Additionally, tanks may need an external cooldown (hand of sacrifice, pain suppression, etc) to survive the impale as their 3 min cooldowns will likely not be up. \r\n\r\nOn Kalecgos', everything will be as above (except 3 min cooldowns should be up for impale) but dps will need to single target the tentacles that come up. The first set should not be too hard. However, the second set will come out during significant raid damage and a raid cooldown (two if needed) should be used. Dps MUST switch and kill them quickly. I recommend melee kill near while ranged far so that the group can remain stacked up. If meeting the cataclysm enrage timer is an issue here, feel free to pop hero as this is, by far, the hardest stage.\r\n\r\nThe second and last phase of the fight is relatively simple by comparison. Your raid will have all their buffs back and will need them. The tentacle adds will come up shortly after you land on the platform and they should be single targeted (10 man) or aoed down (25 man). Any raid member affected by shrapnel must wait for the last minute then click their dream button so as to avoid death. Faiding light from Ultraxion is good practice for this. As soon as the tentacles are dead (before if you are unlucky), the elementium terrors will spawn. They should be picked up immediately, a skull placed on one, and burned down one at a time. The tanks will take significant damage but try to survive it without major cooldowns as it will be much worse the next time (and there will be a next time). Once the adds are dead, as much dps should be put on the boss as possible, but, if lust has not been used, it should still be saved. There will be a second round of adds. They should be handled like the first but the boss will be bleeding fire on the raid at this point and they will be much more dangerous. As soon as the tentacles are dead and the terrors have been picked up and marked, any lust/healer cooldowns (chained) should be used to keep tanks and raid alive. At that point, burn the boss, ignore any third sets of adds that might come, and pray.\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2011-12-18T23:26:50-06:00", "rating": 17, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

It's the \"Stand and Wait\" strategy.\n\nSimply put, don't bring the limb tentacle below 95% health until the Regenerative Blood is all dead.  Most of the raid damage on the platforms comes from Burning Blood, which increases in power as the limbs are damaged.  However, they won't even cast it until they are below 95%.  It might be hard to convince your damage-dealers to hold back, but it's worth it.\n\nIf you do this, there is very little raid damage for most of the fight.  Doing this makes things much easier on the healers.  They can generally maintain full mana until late in the third platform.\n\nSome tips:\n\nA good order is green - red - bronze - blue.\n\nHealers may need to blow cooldowns on the Blistering Tentacles for platforms 3 and 4.  They'll have lots of mana, though.\n\nFor the first three platforms, the Elementium Bolt should come after the Mutated Corruption dies.  It should die before it lands.\n\nThe hardest part of the fight, by far, is surviving the Elementium Bolt on platform 4.  It does a lot of damage, and the Mutated Corruption will probably still be alive, hitting the tank and slamming the raid.  To beat this, have a holy paladin use Divine Protection (bubble) on himself and Hand of Sacrifice on the tank.  He can heal the tank while the bolt arrives.  Everyone else should run under the wing tentacle and pile up with all damage-reduction cooldowns, such as Divine Guardian, Aura Mastery, Rallying Cry, Feint, Raptor Strike (glyphed), etc.  After the Bolt lands, kill it ASAP while scattering to reduce Slam damage.\n\nSeriously, surviving those five seconds is almost the whole fight.  Everything leading up to that is easy.\n\nOn phase 2, the tank will be taking double stacks ot Tetanus from the Elementium Terrors, which will quickly become unhealable.  However, the melee hits from the Elementium Terrors don't do much damage.  You can clear the Tetanus with Hand of Protection and have the tank click it off.  You can have a damage-dealer serve as a temporary tank.  Or, you can just let the tank die.\n\nThe second wave of Elementium Terrors is lethal.  Two healers won't be able to keep up the tank and the rest of the raid, and everyone will be out of cooldowns.

You won't have any dps problems if you were able to beat spine anyway. If you somehow have to rely on a 2H-setup, try not to damage the limb at all before the platform is cleared - the DPS should be sufficient and this might take a lot of stress from the healers (they will probably curse enough during P2).\n\n[b]Changes from normal mode:[/b]\nTwice on each platform during the first phase, a random non-tank will get infected by a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108649]Corrupting Parasite[/url]. After the debuff fades, a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=57479]Parasite[/url] will spawn at the location of the player and start channeling a 10s spell called [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108813]Unstable Corruption[/url]. Basically, he'll explode for the hp he has left divided by 10 when he finishes the cast. Two additional notes: Upon spawning, the Parasite kills nearby players, so there should be none near the infected player (the infected player himself does not die, ofc). Secondly, the time zone will slow down the cast to 15s.\n\nFurthermore, the Bloods spawn a lot earlier on the platforms (right after the first impale hit).\n\nIn phase two, DW will spawn [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=57798]Congealing Bloods[/url] when he reaches 15, 10 or 5% hp. These adds won't do anything but run to DW and heal him by one percent each when they reach him. This might even result in a second blood spawn (e.g. when he's healed to 16% by a blood and damaged to 15% again), so these bloods MUST NOT REACH HIM (caps for srs bsnss here!). \n\n[u][b]Tactics:[/b][/u]\n\n[b]Platform order:[/b]\nThe \"normal\" platform order (Ysera (green), Alexstrasza (red), Nozdormu (gold), Kalecgos (blue)) is optimal for 2T3H setups. If you are completely unable to get enough survival cooldowns for your tanks, you might change Ysera and Alexstrasza.\n\n[b]Dealing with the Parasite:[/b]\n\nOn the first three platforms, place the parasite in the time zone. If your ranged DPS are able to bring it below 30% on their own, don't bother using melees for it (unless it's a melee that spawned it, then he should help out). If the parasite is below 30%, ignore it and kill the big tentacle instead, the explosion will not deal as much damage as the tentacle does.\n\n[b]Surviving the last platform:[/b]\n\nOn Kalecgos' platform, the !@#$ hits the fan: You don't have a time zone left and you're missing the haste buff and several other benefits of the aspects. The damage requirements on this platform are rather high compared to the first three. To get through this, you should place the first parasite near the tentacle to allow every dps to switch to it fast. Burn it down (BL/Heroism plus pots are not a bad choice here). Soon afterwards you will be forced to retreat to the limb as the bolt will impact. Use some your damage reducing cds and raid cds here, finish the bolt and the tentacle while placing the second parasite near the limb. Finish the tentacle and the parasite combined with the bloods and go for the limb. This is a rather hard damage race as you'll have to deal with the limb tentacles twice and it is a rather bad idea to dps the limb below 90% before everything else is finished (your healers are stressed enough). \n\n[b]Phase 2:[/b]\n\nThe good thing about the nerfs (we're at 15% as I'm writing this) is that you have so much time left to beat the enrage timer that you can finish everything on its own: DPS DW until the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=56724]Fragments[/url] spawn, finish them, finish the[url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=56710] Terrors [/url]in the time zone, drop DW below 16%, go for the bloods, return to DW, stop at 12%, kill Fragments and Terrors a second time, drop DW below 11%, go for the bloods, drop DW below 6%, go for the bloods, offtank / dream-use anything and kill him. The only difficult thing about this phase is to reliably slow the Bloods and kill them off fast enough and to go to this phase solidly (after all, it's almost 12 minutes into the fight). While arguably Spine is harder (I'm not that sure about that after the nerfs), take this encounter seriously or you'll wipe a lot more than you expected, wasting just another 12-minute-try. \n\n\n[b]Tanking:[/b] \n[b]P1:[/b]\nThe tank cooldowns for impale are one of the make-or-breaks of the fight. As Impale deals 840k damage and is NOT mitigated by armor, you'll need decent cooldowns for every single one of them. There are tricks around this by using immunity classes, but they are rather difficult to pull off, so you're a lot better with a \"decent\" tank-eats-it tactic. Each platform will take less than 3 minutes, so do your napkin math and assign a perfect cooldown order for all the platforms. Usually, the tank that takes the first Impale will go for the bloods afterwards and pull them whereever it is you need damage.\n\n[b]P2:[/b]\nTank the big tentacles in the time zone, mark one of them immediately. Help out with the bloods as good as you can, your DPS really matters a lot here. \n\n[b]DPSing:[/b]\n[b]P1:[/b]\nThe tentacle is the most important target on each platform unless you are on the parasite. You should be quite familiar with the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=106039]spell weaving[/url] mechanic. As your tank will hopefully bring the bloods to your current target, spread some dots on them to profit from spell weaving. Place yourself decently to avoid triple-hits by the tentacle's slash.\nControl your dps on the leg/arm, especially on platform 3 (do not go below 85% before the tentacle) and 4. (do not go below 95% before the tentacle). Use dream / damage reduces for the second arm-tentacles. Your healers will love you!\n[b]P2:[/b]\nControlled dps and using spell weaving are the key. You need to spread dots and cleave wherever necessary, and you need a reliable slow for the congealing bloods alongside insane burst AoE. \n\n[b]Healing:[/b]\n[b]P1:[/b]\nHelp out the tanks with impale, time your heavy group cds so that you are able to survive the harder parts of platform 3 and 4 (namely the arm tentacles and the bolt impact).\n[b]P2:[/b]\nKeep those tanks alive during [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=106730]Tetanus[/url]. Threaten your stupid DPS to use dream when they still have it after the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=56724]Fragments.[/url]\n\n\nHave fun and see you in Pandaria!", "date": "2012-04-11T03:16:06-05:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-04-20T09:47:56-05:00", 3, "Namnalia"]}

(This was done post-squish, 6.0.2.)\n\nOn my first try, I was running into a healing problem once the [spell=106444] stacks started getting high. To solve that, I just swapped onto the [npc=56471]'s and killed them to avoid the stacks.\n\nOn my successful attempt, this is what I did: Start off on Ysera's platform, and start dpsing the arm. I swapped onto the [npc=56471] as soon as it spawned, and killed it. Then I continued DPSing the arm, and AOE'ed the tiny adds down when they spawned. After I downed that arm, I ran right to the next platform, Nozdormu's. Did the same exact thing on this platform, then ran right again to the next platform, Alexstrasza's. Same thing on this platform, then ran all the way back to the last platform, Kalecgos'. Same idea on this platform, and that should be all the arms/tentacles. After that, I jumped back onto Ysera's platform, and started DPSing Deathwing.

Every platform is relatively the same execution wise, with just a few small differences here and there.\r\n\r\n[b][u]<[b]PHASE ONE[/b]>[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nWhen you get to whatever platform you are currently at, put a little DPS on the claw/tentacle until the Mutated Corruption spawns in. Run over, use small DPS and defense CDs (Ysera's buff) to quickly nuke it down. Use a few death strikes on the claw/tentacle if you need to. Ignore the Blistering Tentacles when they spawn, their damage isn't high enough to be considered a hazard. Kill the Elementium Bolts when they spawn. Quickly kill the Corrupting Parasites, they have very little health and can be almost one-shotted. When the Regenerative Bloods spawn, gather them up and AoE them down, single target any of the ones that are left.\r\n\r\n[b][u]<PHASE TWO>[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nThis is where stuff gets really hard. This phase is a complete DPS race, even more strict than Ultraxion. You have around 20 seconds to nuke Deathwing down for his remaining 3500k health. Drop DoTs on the tentacle so that it will die within a few seconds. Jump to Ysera's platform, [b]pop [b][i]ALL[/i][/b] offensive CDs[/b], and start nuking the hell out of him. Make sure you are constantly using any kind of execute attack, if you happen to have one, as he will already be at 20%. As he drops lower in health, he will spawn Congealing Bloods. If they reach him, he is healed for 1% of his maximum health. As he gets lower and lower, he will spawn more bloods. [u]The strategy is to have Deathwing down before any bloods can reach him.[/u] By the time he is dead, there will be a ton of bloods spawned, and more will spawn anyway if you kill them, so there's no point in bothering with them. If you aren't careful, you could accidentally heal Deathwing up to like 60%. There will also be a lot of damage going out, so [b]make sure you are at full health going into this phase![/b] After a few seconds, 8 little tentacles will spawn, as well as 2 elementals. The tentacles will do small amounts of damage alone, but can drop you by 25% as a whole pack. The elementals hit insanely hard, as they were meant to be picked up by tanks before. After about 4-5 seconds, you want to [b]pop [i]ALL[/i] defense CDs that won't hinder your DPS.[/b] Avoid healing abilities that can interrupt DPS.\r\n\r\nThis is a really tough fight to solo as any class.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 0, "id": 1589341, "nreplies": 2, "sticky": 0, "user": "Iroared", "body": "This is apparently the boss for Spine of Deathwing encounter in [zone=5892].\nLoot for this encounter can be found in [object=209895].\n\nHere is the strategy for normal version (10 man):\n\nThis fight consists of three repeating phases. In each phase the goal is to remove an armor plate from Deathwing's back. Once three plates are successfully removed, you will see a short cutscene and get teleported to the Maelstrom.\n\nDeathwing himself has only one ability - if all players are on the same side of the platform, Deathwing will perform a Barrel Roll in that direction, throwing off all players and Amalgamations not attached to its back.\n\nThroughout the fight, you will encounter several types of adds.\nWhen you start the encounter, you will be dropped onto a small platform with four [npc=56161]. These chain cast [spell=109379] at random raid members, which needs to be healed through. Sometimes they will start channeling [spell=105490], which stuns the target and inflicts large amounts of damage, and needs to be quickly interrupted by damaging or killing the corruption (around 100k damage is enough). When a Corruption is killed, a [npc=53890] is spawned, which should be quickly picked up by a tank, and [npc=53889] will start spawning from the hole left behind by the Corruption. Also, players that get close to the hole will be affected by Grasping Tendrils, which inflicts a small amount of damage and prevents them from being thrown off the back. If no Corruptions are left, a new one will spawn, so there's always at least one up.\nWhen Corrupted Blood is killed, it deals some a little bit of damage to the raid and leaves behind an untargetable residue, which crawls back to the hole, and reconstitutes into a new Corrupted Blood. If Amalgamation is dragged over a residue, it will consume it, and gain a stack of [spell=105248], increasing its damage and attack speed. When Absorbed Blood reaches 9 stacks, it starts dealing intense damage to the raid, so the Amalgamation should be finished off quickly. When it dies with 9 stacks, it casts a [spell=105845], which pries off nearby armor plate and likely kills all players in range. After a plate is pried off, a [npc=56341] appears underneath it, casting [spell=105847]. If the cast is completed, the armor plate is re-sealed.\nAfter the plate is successfully removed, the platform becomes larger and two more Corruptions appear. The whole process repeats, until three armor plates are removed.\n\nThe general strategy is to start off by killing all Corruptions except one or two, then stacking at one of them to throw off all Amalgamations. Kill the one more corruption and have the main tank pick up the Amalgamation. When blood comes out, main tank should taunt it and hold aggro on it, to make sure it dies near the Amalgamation. DPS should attack Amalgamation, until it gets to about 10% health. The remaining Corruption will spam Plasma, so you should assign a healer to spam heals on debuffed players. Every 5 plasma casts or so (can't figure out the exact number), it will grip someone, so you need a couple ranged DPS to quickly switch to it. You should avoid killing it for as long as possible, since it spawns more Amalgamations which the off-tank will need to pick up and drag away from the raid and the blood. Main tank should taunt blood away from the offtank, so his adds do not get stacks.\nOnce the main Amalgamation gets 9 stacks, it should be moved to the very front of the platform and quickly finished off. Everyone should move away from the nuclear blast, and get ready to burst the tendon. After the platform is successfully removed, repeat - kill all but one Corruption and do a barrel roll.\n- It should be noted that the tendon has relatively tight dps requirements, depending on your set up. If a dps gets Fiery Gripped, it can easily mean not killing the tendon in time, so its suggested you assign a ranged dps to bring the last corruption to low health, and then finish it off as the Amalgamation is exploding.", "date": "2011-12-04T12:54:37-06:00", "rating": 84, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "It's actually a aileron roll, not a barrel roll, but meh, close enough.", "creationdate": "2015-02-22T08:39:52-06:00", "id": 842228, "rating": 0, "commentid": 1589341, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Altaria", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "TIL aileron roll = rotation along a forward line, barrel roll = rotation around the outside of a cylinder shape (hence the name barrel)", "creationdate": "2015-04-28T08:51:09-05:00", "id": 866212, "rating": 7, "commentid": 1589341, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "alphabit", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-12-15T17:06:29-06:00", 3, "Iroared"]}
{"commentv2": 1, "number": 1, "id": 1590377, "nreplies": 8, "sticky": 0, "user": "ZelosRaine", "body": "This fight, like many add control fights, is very simple once your raid understands what their individual jobs are. The fight, on 10 man, is as follows but 25 man should differ little:\r\n\r\n1 tank, 3 heals, 6 dps (balanced ranged and melee is nice)\r\n\r\nThe fight will start (and each subsequent phase will as well) with killing tentacles. Your raid will parachute in (everyone should hit esc ASAP). The raid leader, while he is drifting down, should mark a tentacle for everyone NOT to kill. Dps and tanks should quickly kill the other three (the other two on subsequent phases as only 3 will be up for each plate after the initial parachuting in). As soon as all but one tentacle is dead, the raid should stack NEXT to a predetermined burning puddle of blood, then, when Deathwing emotes his barrel roll, should immediately move into the puddle and use ONE raid cooldown (PW:B, Spirit Link, etc). This minimizes the damage from the puddle and helps healer mana (the fight can be very healing intensive). This will cause the three hideous amalgamation that spawn from the dead tentacles to fly off of Deathwing's back (the corrupted bloods cannot be knocked off and will respawn unless handled properly). This process will be performed a total of 3 times: once when landing on Deathwing's back and twice more, once after each of the three plates is destroyed (the third plate ends the encounter, hence no need to perform a barrel roll as you will be happily watching a cut scene).\r\n\r\nOnce you have only one tentacle left, have all dps kill it quickly. The tentacles can channel a stun on raiders which is especially dangerous if individuals are stuck in the fire when it happens. Assign one NON DOT CLASS ranged (hunter, shammy, spriest using mind spike, etc) to keep an eye on the tentacle (there will always be at least one up) in order to break the stun quickly. The stun breaks once 20% of the tentacles health has been done as damage. DO NOT KILL THE tentacle as it will spawn another amalgamation and likely wipe the raid. Also HEALERS SHOULD NOTE that the tentacles will put a healing debuff on randon raiders that absorbs a large amount of healing and does damage. Healers should focus on spam healing these people ASAP as it is a very dangerous debuff considering all the other spikey raid damage that can happen. \r\n\r\nAt this point, the tank should have the hideous amalgamation in the middle of Deathwing's back, immediately next to the armor plate to be destroyed. All dps should burn the amalgamation while the tank focuses on taunting bloods and cleaving them down. Once the  amalgamation is sub 20-30%, dps can SINGLE TARGET the bloods. The bloods do an aoe when killed and, if too many are killed at once, can stack the debuff on the amalgamation far too quickly for your raid to react properly. The tank should be sure to move the amalgamation around a bit as it has to physically pass through the puddles of blood left by the dead corruption to gain the debuff. Once the debuff has reached 9 stacks, the amalgamation will begin doing VERY high raid wide damage. The raid needs to closely manage their dps going into this point. Ideally, the amalgamation will be sub 5% when the last stack is applied and the dps can kill it nearly instantly. However, it is better to take slightly more raid damage than risk not getting 9 stacks as killing the add without 9 stacks will mean a repetition of the entire process and a likely wipe (the number of bloods increases exponentially as the fight goes on, creating a soft enrage). \r\n\r\nOnce the amalgamation is killed with 9 stacks, everyone should run away from it immediately as it will, after a few seconds, blow up in a massive explosion which will instantly kill anyone near it. As soon as this happens, the only real dps check of the fight will occur. The add's explosion will cause the plate to, after a few moment, lift up and reveal a \"burning tendon.\" All raiders (including tank and healers) should make a \"/tar burning\" macro and should use all dps possible to kill it. The tendon casts for 23 seconds but is unattackable for 5 of those seconds, leaving your raid with 17 seconds to kill it. If you fail to kill it, it means repeating the entire process again and will likely lead to a wipe. \r\n\r\nStrategies for maximizing dps in this phase include the following. All dps should save all cooldowns for the tendon. EVERYONE SHOULD STACK ON THE TENDON when it appears (be careful NOT to stack in the pool of burning blood next to it). Everyone, including healers, should maximize dps on the tendon. Obviously, if people need heals, healers should heal. However, if no one is below 50%, healers should focus on doing any damage they reasonably can. Obviously, this means that the dps and tank should be doing outstanding dps during this phase as it is their only time to let loose. The strategy that worked for my raid group was: For the 1st tendon, use all dps cooldowns that had a cooldown of less than 5 minutes; for the 2nd tendon, use hero/lust and any one minute cooldowns; for the 3rd tendon, use any and everything we could (5min and ten minute cds). If a stun goes out during this phase, ignore it and continue dps. However, it is very important that any stuns BEFORE this phase be broken immediately as every bit of dps is needed. \r\n\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2011-12-05T10:05:34-06:00", "rating": 34, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "It is not recommended to use one tank because, as you said, if a second corruption is killed, it will likely wipe you.

Healers [i]will[/i] have to blow cooldowns at certain points to keep everyone alive.\n\nFirst, right when you roll, lots of people will have Searing Plasma, as there were just three or four Corruptions applying it.  At the same time, everyone will be jumping into the holes, which means the whole raid will be taking damage.  There will also be two or three Amalgamations up, so the tanks (or other raid members!) will be taking extra damage. Note that this happens [i]right at the beginning of the fight[/i], so watch out!  Blow cooldowns [i]before[/i] the roll so that you can clear all the Searing Plasma before the AoE damage starts.\n\nSecond, and obviously, when the Amalgamation gets nine stacks of Absorb Blood, heavy raid damage and even heavier tank damage go out.  Look for raid-wide damage-reducers (aura mastery, bubbles, Divine Guardian, \"Raid Wall\", etc.), and hope your tank is blowing his cooldowns.  Better yet, get the Amalgamation to very low health before stacking up the Absorb Blood, so you don't have to put up with it for long.\n\nWhen someone gets Fiery Grip, they take heavy single-target damage.  Watch out for the debuff and be ready to heal them hard, especially if it's a fellow healer or they have Plasma.\n\nAlso, for the whole fight, you have to keep Searing Plasma clear while not running out of mana.  A single tentacle casting the 10-man normal version requires 25,000 HPS to keep clear, and it [i]has[/i] to be clear when you hit the AoE damage parts of the fight.\n\nTanks and damage-dealers need to be aware that healers are burning up mana dealing with Searing Plasma, and do what they can to reduce incoming damage.

It is by no means supposed to be the \"best\" way to do it, it merely was the best solution for OUR raid!\n\n[b]Setup[/b]\n- 2 Tanks (druid, paladin)\n- 3 Healers (priest, shaman, druid)\n- 5 DDs (hunter, mage, rogue, warlock, priest)\n\n[b]Fight breakdown[/b]\nPull - \nkill 3 corruptions - 1st roll - kill last corruption, amalgamation - tendon 1a - kill corruption, amalgamation - tendon 1b - \nkill 3 corruptions - 2nd roll - kill corrupion, amalgamation - tendon 2a - kill corruption, amalgamation - tendon 2b - \nkill 3 corruptions - 3rd roll - kill corruption, amalgamation - tendon 3a - kill corruption, amalgamation - tendon 3b\n\n[b]Details[/b]\nThe fight mechanics are simple and straight-forward. The hard part is to not get overwhelmed by the blood adds and general incoming damage. They were tanked by the paladin and constantly nuked by the hunter. The healers can call for time-off when things got tight but this shouldn't happen too often. The whole raid should bomb them during the second roll, but not during the last. Instead, they are bombed after the roll, because the Amalgamations are likely fully soaked before the roll and deal a lot of damage. Towards the end of the fight, after Tendon 3a (during which the hunter keeps bombing the blood if possible), you'll get to a point where's too much blood. Proceed to kite them, using paladin and warlock stuns for every change of direction.\nRaid cooldowns are used during rolls 2 and 3 and Amalgamation explosions, assign them beforehand. Ours were: SL totem + hymn during rolls, tranquility for the explosion. The non healer cooldowns were called by our main healer whenever necessary. Also assign someone to backup the dispeller when they are casting their cooldown.\nThe Almagamation is tanked near the plate and nuked fast. Mind to kill it right when Fiery Grip comes off cool down, else it would disrupt the Tendon phase. Be ready to call for a nuke stop if you're too fast.

The difficulty lies in the Roll mechanics though, so it's not a walk in the park. I soloed it with my ilvl 569 rogue on patch day and it took me about a dozen tries to execute a working strategy. Since I'm kind of a klutz, you can probably do better. I also soloed it with my ilvl 574 destruction warlock with an amended strategy.\n\nNote that the strategy outlined below will work with most DPS classes. Just substitute your favorite nukes for the spells mentioned below. It's better to have an instant AOE type attack for the residue gathering phase, and some kind of damage mitigation for the Amalgamation kiting phase. Self heals are very helpful (duh.)\n\nSo far I've only tried 10-man normal mode.\n\n[u]Talent choices:[/u]\n\n     [b]Rogue:[/b] The only relevant talents I used are [spell=108211] and [spell=114014]. You don't want to choose anything else on those tiers. Since you deal massively more damage to level 85~88 creatures, Leeching poison will heal you for a ton of health each time it is applied. Shuriken Toss is extraordinarily helpful on this encounter.\n    [b]Warlock:[/b] I used [spell=108503] because I did not want to have to manage a pet. I sacrificed a voidwalker for the shield. I also used [spell=108370] for the shield generated by Incinerate and Chaos Bolt, which is very good given that the shield is proportional to damage dealt and you deal increased damage (there is a cap of 15% of your max health though)\n  \n[u]Initial notes:[/u]\nYou are never ever in the center of the spine. You are always slightly to to the left or slightly to the right and you will ALWAYS trigger a roll wherever you are standing. Deathwing waits a few seconds (I think 5) before starting a roll sequence, and that cooldown will reset only if he actually rolls. If you triggered a right roll sequence and move to the left before 5 or 6 seconds, you will immediately reset the roll timer and trigger a left roll sequence. This means that unless you are secured by a dead [npc=56162] thanks to [spell=105563], you will have to constantly move back and forth between both sides to avoid getting thrown off.\nThe Corruptions will not stun the main aggro target. That's you.\n\n[b][u]Strategy:[/u][/b]\n\n[u]1- initial phase[/u]\nStart by killing 3 [npc=56162]  with your shuriken toss for your rogue, or [spell=29722] with your warlock, then stand on a dead corruption to anchor yourself to the [spell=105563]. tank and kill the [npc=53890]s. If you are too slow killing them Deathwing will eject the remaining ones anyway.\n\n[u]2- Gathering Residues[/u]\n\n[b]Rogue: [/b] Two strategies:\n     a- Standing on a dead corruption and waiting for [npc=53889] to spawn. Try to shuriken toss them when they are in the center of the spine if possible, that will make the next steps easier. If a corrupted blood spawns under you, run to the other side and anchor yourself to another dead Corruption and shuriken toss the incoming blood. The reason for that is that if you kill the blood on top of the dead corruption, it will respawn immediately (see [spell=105223].) Repeat that sequence until you have 9 blood residues close to the middle of the spine. Advantage: you don't have to move much. Drawback: it's hard to stack the residues in the center and you have to cross the spine if a blood spawns under you, making sure DW is not in the middle of a roll sequence.\n\n    b- Place yourself in the center of the spine and start running around in a small circle to continually reset the roll sequence. [spell=51723] the incoming bloods (obviously not available to you in combat spec) until you have 9+ residues in the center of the spine. Advantage: the residues will be nicely stacked . Drawback: not sure. Maybe YOU'll get dizzy. \nI have not implemented this strategy yet but I'll try next week. I am mentioning it because this is basically what i do with my Warlock.\n\n[b]Warlock: [/b] Place yourself in the center of the spine and start running around in a small circle to continually reset the roll sequence. Drop a [spell=5740] in the center of the spine and refresh it every 8 seconds. the incoming bloods will die within a couple ticks and stack nicely in the center. Continue until you have 9+ residues in the center of the spine.\n\n\n[u]3- Dealing with the Amalgamation and Tendon[/u]\n\nShuriken toss/Conflagrate the last standing corruption and start kiting the incoming Hideous Amalgamation on the residues. Don't forget to constantly move back and forth between the left side and the right side of the spine. When the Amalgamation is up to 9 stacks and gets [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=106264]superheated[/url], kite it to the armor plate and kill it. You WILL have to also move back and forth during the kill, always hugging the armor plate. A little bit of a pain with a rogue. A warlock can toss one chaos bolt at it and be done with it.\n\nWhen the amalgamation is dead, go hug a dead corruption that is close to the armor plate. Wait patiently until the amalgamation explodes and Shuriken Toss/Incinerate the Burning Tendon. (a macro that does /tar Burning Tendon /cast Shuriken Toss/incinerate is handy there.)\nThis is also your opportunity to use self heals ([spell=114635] or anything at your disposal. A rogue will have to tank and melee a hideous amalgamation to leech life from it)\n\nAfter the plate flies away, kill all standing corruptions and start over.\n\n[u]Additional Considerations:[/u]\n\nyour Shuriken Toss does not trigger poisons. This means the only healing you get is by doing melee attacks on targets that will not get one-shot. That means amalgamations only. Hitting an amalgamation 2 or 3 times will heal you fully.\nYou should not have too many health issues while killing bloods, but if you do, kill the last standing corruption and rush to melee the new amalgamation to death. Don't let it reach residues. If you are a warlock, you can use Ember Tap to heal yourself.\n\nIt can be a little tricky when you are kiting the amalgamation, especially if the residues are spread all across the board. Your health may dip a little low at that time. \nIf that happens and you are feeling up to it, kill the last corruption and kill the new amalgamation but don't let it compete for residues with the one you are kiting, which can be tricky considering you are constantly moving back and forth on the spine to avoid ejection. A 5-point recuperate, health potion and avoidance (evasion, combat readiness, Sacrificial Pact/ Shadow Bulwark) can go a long way.\n\nMadness of Deathwing is a complete joke after that.\nGood luck on your [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=77067]Blazing Drake[/url]/[item=77069]!", "date": "2014-10-16T10:28:43-05:00", "rating": 42, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I am a balance druid and I didn't really understand the fight, thank you for helping me figure it out.

The trick, to me, is to finish it before you become overwhelmed by the number of blood adds up, and that the amalgamations do not start casting nuclear until they are low on HP, below 20k it seemed. To beat this I had to have a specific strategy, because I lacked any significant heals, although I had spec'd into Cold Snap for the long CD heal. I tried several methods to beat this:\n[ul][li]Letting all the bloods pile up on me before killing the tentacle and nearly killing the amalgamation, killing the bloods all at once and then lowering the HP of the amalgamation as I ran for a grip[/li]\n[li]Killing the bloods one at a time near or on the center of the spine, and keeping count up, then killing the tentacle, and then the amalgamation to about 100k, then letting it stack the bloods before pushing it to go nuclear.[/li]\n[li][b]The strategy that worked: Killing the bloods three groups of 3 on the center of the spine, leaving the last group of 3 up when I killed the tentacle. Then I dps'd the amalgamation to about 100-130k, kited the amalg over the dead bloods, then immediately used blizzard on it and the bloods right next to the plates to get it to 9 stacks, then chipping the rest of the amalg's HP until it started its cast. This strat's main purposes were:[/b][ul][li]To keep my ice barrier from burning out as frequently as would happen when keeping all 9 bloods alive, thus minimizing HP loss and the necessity to use my long CD Cold Snap.[/li]\n[li]To keep the dead bloods fairly close together and where I needed them to be for easier kiting/killing of the amalg.[/li]\n[li]To minimize the damage I took from fully buffed amalgamations, reducing my need to keep Cold Snap on cooldown, and leaving me with more HP to deal with the future waves of bloods, which become very hectic to deal with.[/li][/ul][/li][/ul]\n\nRight at the start, I did nothing, until I knew a roll was coming. Then I would kill 3 of the tentacles, get into a grip, and let the roll push the amalgs out, less damage incoming, less mobs in general, less worry for me. I found that, between the strategies of constantly moving back and forth over the spine and staying in one spot for the turns, with only 3 bloods up, it was immensely easier to just keep moving back and forth.\n\nThe bloods themselves I would kill as close as I could to the plate, and when ready to build stacks, I would kite the amalg along the side of the plate, from one side of the spine to the other. When I killed the tentacles, I would keep the amalg 5 yards or so from the plates, to make sure I didn't get any unintentional stacks. As the encounter moves on, you get more and more bloods showing up, and not only can you, but you need to stack them near the plates, and kill them as soon as you get 3 or more. Once you've killed two packs, and have a third set of three or nearly so, kill a tentacle and dps the amalg to ~115k, enough for 2-3 non-crits to set it off into nuclear, then aoe and drop it to low HP.\n\nIf, for some reason I found myself overwhelmed by bloods, I would take them to the oppose side of the encounter from the next plate, and aoe them there. I found it gave me enough time to get the next set of adds in line and get the amalgamation stacks going, and be well into the next plate phase before the pools respawned as blood adds.\n\nOnce I got the strategy cemented, I just had to remember to keep moving across the spine, keep the bloods near the plate on the center of the spine when I killed them. The last plate was very hectic, bloods were spawning almost constantly, and my ice barrier was battered, with me being at 30-40% health and cold snap on CD. I had to pop mirror images to let myself escape from the amalgamation and set it off from a grip point. From there I just let it blow up, and killed the last tendon, popping my CDs just to be sure I killed it fast enough to beat the bloods killing me at that point.", "date": "2014-10-23T02:14:12-05:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I was asking in our guild about mages soloing this.

This means that unless you are secured by a dead [npc=56162] thanks to [spell=105563], you will have to constantly move back and forth between both sides to avoid getting thrown off.\nThe Corruptions will not stun you.\n\n[b][u]Strategy:[/u][/b]\n\n[u]1- initial phase[/u]\nStart by killing 3 [npc=56162]s with [spell=29722] , then stand on a dead corruption to anchor yourself to the [spell=105563]. tank the incoming [npc=53890]s but do not kill them! [spell=106005] will stack for every amalgamation you kill. Those thrown off by Deathwing do not count, so just wait for Deathwing to complete a roll sequence.\nA couple seconds after you engage an amalgamation, it will infect you with [spell=106199]. Dispel it [u]immediately[/u] with Singe Magic. It will automatically transform into [spell=106200], which will buff you with damage reduction after 15 seconds.\nThis is the most crucial part of this fight. EVERY time you engage a new amalgamation or a new pack thereof, they will cast blood corruption. Use any means necessary to track the debuff and be quick dispelling it. I used TellMeWhen to track the debuff.\n\nNormally an amalgamation will only cast it once on you, but if you spend too much time killing or kiting it, it will recast it after maybe 25 seconds. Since the cooldown of Singe Magic is 15 seconds, you're covered.\n\n[u]2- Gathering Residues[/u]\n\na few seconds after the amalgamations learn to fly, place yourself in the center of the spine and start running around in a small circle to continually reset the roll sequence. Drop a [spell=5740] in the center of the spine and refresh it every 8 seconds. the incoming bloods will die within a few ticks and stack nicely in the center. Continue until you have 9+ residues in the center of the spine. Alternatively you can incinerate them to benefit from the shield effect of Soul Leech. Note that they will start crawling towards a dead corruption and as a result will be a little spread out when you're done.\n\n[u]3- Dealing with the Amalgamation and Tendon[/u]\n\nConflagrate the last standing corruption and throw a Chaos Bolt at the incoming Hideous Amalgamation to tenderize it a bit. Ideally you want it down to 20% life before you kite it so you can shadowburn it fast when it is time to kill it. Start kiting it on the residues. Don't forget to constantly move back and forth between the left side and the right side of the spine and DON'T FORGET TO DISPEL YOURSELF. I died a ridiculous number of times because I was not focused on my debuffs. When the Amalgamation is up to 9 stacks and gets [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=106264]superheated[/url], kite it to the armor plate and kill it. You WILL have to also move back and forth during the kill, always hugging the armor plate.\n\nWhen the amalgamation is dead, go hug a dead corruption that is close to the armor plate. Wait patiently until the amalgamation explodes and Incinerate the Burning Tendon. This is also your opportunity to use self heals ([spell=114635] or anything else at your disposal).\n\nAfter the plate flies away, kill all standing corruptions and start over.\n\n[u]Additional Considerations:[/u]\n\nDid I mention you need to dispel yourself?

[i]Make sure you don't spam [spell=77758] as this will kill the [npc=53890].[/i]\n\nWhen a [npc=53889] dies, it will leave a small graphical little bubble on the back of Deathwing, pulling the [npc=53890] over to that, will make the mob absorb that [npc=53889] and it will gain a stack of [spell=105248]. You will need to get nine [spell=105248] stacks on a single [npc=53890], as it will start [spell=105834], which in order will start [spell=105845] on death. [b]Make sure to pull the [npc=53890] close to the Armor Plate before killing it[/b] which is where you already should be at.\n\nWhen [spell=105845] hits one of Deathwing's Elemental Plates, it will go away for a couple of seconds allowing you to hit his [npc=56341]. Here is a good place to just spam damaging abilities and mainly [spell=77758]. I had to do every Tendon twice in order to kill it.\n\nYou need to kill three tendons before the next Cutscene appears, which will trigger you to the Maelstrom.

The toughest part of this fight is the deathwing roll and being able to survive some heavy hits.  If you solo this, Deathwing will be barrel rolling like a mad man because you are supposed to balance your raid party on the right and left side of his back which is impossible to do on your own.  Once he feels more people on one side of his back, after a 3-4 second delay, he rolls and if you are not in one of the tentacle holes you die.  \n\nYou want to start out by destroying 3-4 of the original tentacles, there will always be one that re-spawns so you should only have one up at any given time.  Once you are down to one tentacle up ignore it and get into a hole.  After destroying a tentacle a few things will happen, a humanoid elemental called [npc=53890] will spawn and start smacking you for each tentacle destroyed and the holes that the tentacles were in will be open and spawn these fiery spiky slime things called [npc=53889].  Here is what i recommend after destroying the first set of tentacle immediately run into one of the open holes, this will keep you on deathwing's back even when you rolls, and start spamming [spell=116694] this will keep you alive while the Amalgamations smack you. You can completely ignore them initially cause as soon as deathwing rolls for the first time they fly off his back.  Now what you have to do is stay in that hole, top off your health when needed with surging mist and collect the Corrupted Bloods that spawn without killing them.  They DO NOT get flung off deathwing's back during a roll. You want to get to 9 Bloods for what you need to do with them next but I always mess up the next part so sometimes I just wait around for 7ish cause I get impatient.  Once you get the 7-9 Bloods you need to wait for just after a deathwing roll, otherwise your timing might be off and you'll get flung off during a roll, and then run to the one tentacle still up and destroy it. If you recall doing this spawns an Amalgamation which is what you need next.  The gang of Bloods (see what I did there) that you have collected will need to be killed which leaves behind a fiery puddle for a bit.  Without killing the Amalgamation you must run him through the blood puddles.  Doing so give him a buff that stacks up to 9 times, maybe more idk you just need 9.  The buff makes him hit harder and gives him some more beef I think so this is where you may need to pop some heals and Touch of Karma to stay alive.  Keep in mind if deathwing rolls during this the Amalgamation will fly off and you'll have to start over by gather Corrupted Bloods again.  To prevent deathwing from rolling you must run across his spine from side to side ever few seconds.  Going from one side to the other will stop a roll before it happens and prepare him to roll the other way.  This is where the monks mobility and rolls come in handy to quickly get to his other side.  It will give you a warning in game when he is preparing to roll (maybe you need DBM for that? I think it might tell you regardless).  Once you see that warning you have a few second before it says \"deathwing rolls\".  If it says that and you are not in a tentacle hole you will die.  So you have your Amalgamation chasing you as you run back and forth from left to right over death wings spine trying to get 9 stacks of the Corrupted Bloods dead body puddles.  Once you get the 9th stack kill the Amalgamation right in front of the armor plating sticking up on his back (it's the one towards his head with a little point in the middle).  If it's not close enough to the plate when it dies and detonates (goes nuclear) then you'll have to redo everything from the beginning.  The Amalgamation will only detonate if it has the 9 stacks.  If you succeed then the plate will start to come off and reveal a fiery ball tendon that you can target for a short duration.  You must destroy this tendon to detach the armor plating on deathwing's back completely.  If you don't do it fast enough the plate will reseal and you'll have to start over.  Once the plate is off there will be two more tentacle holes and you'll have to repeat the above steps two more times to remove a total of three armored plates from deathwing's back.  Once you remove the third the encounter ends and you'll feel a sense of achievement after dying 10ish times trying to figure the fight out.   \n\nTips for WW monks. \n If you play a monk like me you use your rolls and flying serpent kick to get around faster.  I would remove flying serpent kick from your button mappings during this fight if you feel like you'll unconsciously press it like me cause what killed me the most was serpent kicking too far and flying off of his back.  Rolling is so so useful in getting from one side of his back to the other quickly to prevent a deathwing roll.  Surging Mist was my self heal of choice and made the overall encounter incredibly easy to stay alive for.  When you are kiting the Amalgamation is when you have to be careful of your health the most because when he gets those stack he starts taking out big chunks of your health.  Touch of Karma and Chi Wave helped keep me alive through this.  Finally don't get discouraged if you die a lot the first time because it is a tough fight to solo with all the mechanics :D", "date": "2014-11-12T14:38:21-06:00", "rating": 10, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2014-11-13T01:30:02-06:00", 1, "shaitan22305"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 91, "id": 3365342, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Ceraina", "body": "Solo Spine of Deathwing\n\nI'm giving a TLDR version, but I highly recommend the (very) long version. It's all the things I learned the hard way, along with detailed notes of [b]how and why[/b] you're doing each step. Had I known this before I started my grind for the drake (which is still ongoing), I would have spared myself a lot of frustration, agony, and repair bills for the many deaths I took flying off DW's back. It took reading a bunch of other people's posts to find all of this information. I'm trying to compile it into a single post, cause, while nothing will make this fight easy to solo, hopefully this will save you the time of finding each little nugget of info upon flying off DW's back, to try to figure out why you died.\n\nThe TLDR version:\n1. Land\n2. Kill 3 of the tentacles you see, leaving one alive. Stand where one of the tentacles was. Leaving one alive is critical.\n3. Wait for 9 corrupted bloods to spawn. This will be a lesson in patience.\n4. Gather 9 bloods together and kill. \n5. Wait till after a roll finishes, then start the Deathwing Dance (see below for details). You must move from one side to the other about every 8 seconds. DBM is strongly recommended for this.\n6. While keep up the DW dance every 8 seconds, kill the last tentacle. \n7. Keep dancing while you lead the amalgamation moving along with you. He's soaking up the residue left from the deaths of the 9 bloods. He has a ticker next to his name that is 0 when it spawns. Once he has absorbed 9 residues, the ticker will be at 9. \n8. Bring the amalgamation as close to DW's spine as possible (nearest his head). DPS the amalgamation to 1 health. Wait for the amalgamation to go nuclear. Keep dancing.\n9. Once DW's burning tendon is exposed, kill it. Spine section pops off. Still dancing thru this.\n10. Repeat steps 2-9.\n11. Repeat steps 2-9 again. \n12. Autoparachute off DW's back and grab your loot.\n\n\nDetailed version with critical info if you're not very familiar with this fight. \n\nUpon landing after the cinematic, you'll see four tentacles.\n\nKill all but one tentacle and then stand in the empty spot where one was before you killed it. I recommend leaving one of the tentacles nearest DW's spine (facing his head) alive, but that's not necessary. It's just efficient.\n\nI emphasize that you[b] must[/b] leave one [url=https://www.wowhead.com/npc=56162/corruption] tentacle[/url] alive. If you kill them all, they will respawn, but if you leave one alive, the rest stay dormant. It is especially likely they will respawn in the hold where you're standing, right about the time you see DBM say, \"Deathwing rolls <direction>). In such a situation (and I encountered this a LOT), you will not have time to kill the new tentacle before you're floating away from Deathwing's spine. And after a split second, cool moment of floating, instant death.\n\nImmediately after a tentacle's death, a [url=https://www.wowhead.com/npc=53890/hideous-amalgamation]hideous amalgamation[/url] will spawn. So you will see three of those, along with a [url=https://www.wowhead.com/npc=53889/corrupted-blood]Corrupted Blood[/url] or two. You can ignore all of them for the moment. Your first priority is to get in the spot where a tentacle was. \n\nReason: There is a debuff, [url=https://www.wowhead.com/spell=105563/grasping-tendrils] grasping tendrils[/url], from the spot where the tentacle was that will keep you rooted in place, even during DW rolls. Once you see that debuff, you you are good for the next part.\n\nSo you're secure on DW's back, and you aren't going to float away and die. Now back to the mobs. Ignore the three hideous amalgamations that spawned with the first three tentacle deaths. The first time DW rolls, they will all float away and die. It is a beautiful sight to see.\n\nSo now you're gonna stand around for while. As long as you've followed the above, you can take an afk and grab a beer, let the dog out, or whatever you want. You are just sitting in that root spot waiting for 9 corrupted bloods to spawn. They will slowly trickle out of the three empty tentacle spots. It's usually a couple minutes for the first spine section. And all the while, DW is rolling around, treating you like a flea on his back, while you act like a tick. There's even blood involved. Lots of them.\n\nWhy 9 bloods? Each corrupted blood will leave a \"residue\" on dying. Each time a hideous amalgamation crosses that residue, he absorbs it and the counter next to his nameplate will tick up one. He starts at 0 and needs to get to 9. You do not need to have the corrupted bloods alive for the amalgamation to absorb the residue. It's usually easier to kill the bloods before killing the last tentacle. My recommendation is to gather all the bloods in a single spot as close to the center of DW's spine (nearest his head) and use your best AOE to kill them all at once. But if you move out of the rooted spot, know you've got about 8 seconds to start the Deathwing Dance.4 \n\nNow that you've got 9 residues as close to DW's spine as you can get 'em, you should step out of the spot you're standing in. Now you're gonna do the Deathwing Dance, and ensure that DW doesn't roll again for the current spine session. I'm gonna pause here for an explanation, cause this is the second piece of soloing that killed me (a lot). \n\nAs you've probably seen in the part of the fight where you're waiting for 9 bloods, DW rolls - a LOT. If you have DBM (and I highly recommend it), you have seen a lot of \"Deathwing rolls <right/left>\" depending on which side you decided to root your ass in. And every time he rolled, anything not nailed down flew off. Remember that beautiful sight to see the amalgamations flying away with the first roll? It's a sight for tears now, if you don't manage the Deathwing Dance, even if you've managed to root yourself before the roll. Cause you need that amalgamation that spawned with the last tentacle dying. \n\nSo the Deathwing Dance is you moving from left to right, right to left, before DW rolls. Once you see the DBM warning that Deathwing is about to roll, you have approximately 9 seconds before he actually rolls. So you know that ole Waltz thing, \"Dance, two, three, four?\" Well I do that with a \"five, six, seven, eight\" in my head while I keep my eye on the amalgamation. On eight, I move to DW's other side. You will almost immediately get the DBM warning that he's gonna roll again. Just sing your countdown. No need to run around like a headless chicken every 2-3 seconds like I've seen in some videos. \n\n[b]So yeah, the Deathwing Dance is just moving from side to side about every 8 seconds. That's all. Easiest dance you'll learn today.\n[/b]\nRemember the amalgamation? It's the only way DW's spine is going to open up. And it takes more than the time between rolls for this to happen. The good news? If you miss and roll, as long as you're in a tentacle section that hasn't respawned, you will stay on for the roll. And once the roll is over, look around, kill a tentacle, and wait for another amalgamation to spawn. The better news, that DW Dance moving around is good, cause it helps the amalgamation absorb residue faster, as long as you're dancing through the residue with the amalgamation.\n\nSo the amalgamation ticker is at 9? Now what? Kill the MF, while still doing the DW dance. Here's where any instant casts you have available should be used. At Shadowlands level, it shouldn't take much to bring him to 1 health. \n\nHe doesn't die right way. Instead, he gets pissy with you and decides he's gonna go nuclear. For real. \n\nYou want to make sure he nukes as close to DW spine as you can. This is where having the living tentacle from earlier and the blood residue be nearest the spine is efficient. If he nukes too far from the spine, you get to rinse and repeat. If he is close enough, a piece of DW's spine breaks off, revealing a burning tendon. DPS that tendon (easy to do now). Once it's dead, two more tentacles show up, and you're going to repeat this process to blow off section two of the spine. And, as if you haven't already had enough fun with the first two, you get one final tendon section on which to repeat exactly what you did the first two times. \n\nIt won't take as long for the bloods on rounds 2 and 3 - because each time, you have two additional new tentacle spots from which the bloods spawn.\n\nOnce you've successfully disabled his spine, you're gonna parachute off his back, thinking he's dead. *Spoiler alert* - He's not. Yet. But you do get a second chance at him, along with a pair of cool mounts.\n\nHappy hunting.

Thousands of years ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Titans with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old Gods, he turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients. Among both mortals and dragons his name has become one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt.[b]*[/b]\n\nHe created the artifact known as the Dragon Soul, which had great power. Driven mad by the Old gods,  he used this to exact power over the \"lesser beings\", and the other dragon races. He also wiped almost all of the Blue Dragonflight out of existence. \n\nThe growing corruption in Neltharion's heart warped his body, as the angelic dragon began taking a more demonic appearance, similar to how Sargeras  changed to a more demonic form after his corruption. Neltharion's body cracked open, revealing his molten heart, and magma and fire flowed off his chest. His eyes became aflame in red, demonstrating the magnitude of his power and the depths of his evil. Thus was Deathwing the Destroyer born, and the Dragon Soul was renamed: the Demon Soul.[b]*[/b]\n\nDeathwing returned to his lair beneath a mountain. His proximity to the Demon Soul was ripping his body apart, so the goblins forged an armor of adamantium to serve as a vessel to contain Deathwing's raging powers and keep them in check. Only the adamantium plates kept the power from destroying his body. [b]*[/b]\n\nMalfurion Stormrage used the Emerald Dream to find Deathwing's lair and stole the Demon Soul from the black dragon. After the Burning Legion was defeated, the Dragon Aspects sealed the Demon Soul with their energies, so that Deathwing should never be able to manipulate the Demon Soul. The artifact was hidden in an undisclosed location by Malfurion at the request of the Dragon Aspects. No longer in possession of the artifact and now unable to use it, Deathwing vowed to destroy most life and to wreak havoc on the planet. With his powers over earth, Neltharion caused volcanoes to rise along with the destruction already caused by the Well of Eternity's implosion, sinking most of Kalimdor below the ocean. [b]*[/b]\n\nThe black aspect involved himself in Second War, adopting the form of Lord Daval Prestor, in order to destroy the Alliance from within. He also managed to turn his greatest enemy, Alexstrasza, into a slave of the Horde, with whom he later allied himself. After suffering a series of defeats culminating with his being chased off by the other Aspects, Deathwing retreated to the elemental plane Deepholm to recuperate. From Deepholm, Deathwing observed his former mate Sintharia's experiments with the twilight dragonflight in Grim Batol. Deathwing now continues his late consort's work.[b]*[/b]\n\nDeathwing will make his return as the primary antagonist in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, the third expansion.Though long believed by most to be dead, Deathwing is regaining his strength in Deepholm and plotting a return that will shake Azeroth to its foundations.[b]*[/b]\n\nDeathwing has control over the land and its fathoms, including lava. His main attack, and that of his dragonflight's, is to use his breath as a cannon of lava.

Thousands of years ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Titans with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old Gods, he turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients. Among both mortals and dragons his name has become one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt.*\r\n\r\nHe created the artifact known as the Dragon Soul, which had great power. Driven mad by the Old gods, he used this to exact power over the \"lesser beings\", and the other dragon races. He also wiped almost all of the Blue Dragonflight out of existence. \r\n\r\nThe growing corruption in Neltharion's heart warped his body, as the angelic dragon began taking a more demonic appearance, similar to how Sargeras changed to a more demonic form after his corruption. Neltharion's body cracked open, revealing his molten heart, and magma and fire flowed off his chest. His eyes became aflame in red, demonstrating the magnitude of his power and the depths of his evil. Thus was Deathwing the Destroyer born, and the Dragon Soul was renamed: the Demon Soul.*\r\n\r\nDeathwing returned to his lair beneath a mountain. His proximity to the Demon Soul was ripping his body apart, so the goblins forged an armor of adamantium to serve as a vessel to contain Deathwing's raging powers and keep them in check. Only the adamantium plates kept the power from destroying his body. *\r\n\r\nMalfurion Stormrage used the Emerald Dream to find Deathwing's lair and stole the Demon Soul from the black dragon. After the Burning Legion was defeated, the Dragon Aspects sealed the Demon Soul with their energies, so that Deathwing should never be able to manipulate the Demon Soul. The artifact was hidden in an undisclosed location by Malfurion at the request of the Dragon Aspects. No longer in possession of the artifact and now unable to use it, Deathwing vowed to destroy most life and to wreak havoc on the planet. With his powers over earth, Neltharion caused volcanoes to rise along with the destruction already caused by the Well of Eternity's implosion, sinking most of Kalimdor below the ocean. *\r\n\r\nThe black aspect involved himself in Second War, adopting the form of Lord Daval Prestor, in order to destroy the Alliance from within. He also managed to turn his greatest enemy, Alexstrasza, into a slave of the Horde, with whom he later allied himself. After suffering a series of defeats culminating with his being chased off by the other Aspects, Deathwing retreated to the elemental plane Deepholm to recuperate. From Deepholm, Deathwing observed his former mate Sintharia's experiments with the twilight dragonflight in Grim Batol. Deathwing now continues his late consort's work.*\r\n\r\nDeathwing will make his return as the primary antagonist in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, the third expansion.Though long believed by most to be dead, Deathwing is regaining his strength in Deepholm and plotting a return that will shake Azeroth to its foundations.*\r\n\r\nDeathwing has control over the land and its fathoms, including lava. His main attack, and that of his dragonflight's, is to use his breath as a cannon of lava. He can live within volcanoes and high temperature areas[/quote] \r\n\r\nI thought Neltharion is deathwings son in Blackwing Descent but if wowhead said it then i guess there right", "date": "2011-10-31T13:18:29-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thats Nefarian and he is deathwings son however deathwing is neltharion", "creationdate": "2011-11-11T16:19:23-06:00", "id": 277151, "rating": 3, "commentid": 1558568, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "W3r3w0lf", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Was it really necessary to quote the entire comment?", "creationdate": "2012-01-31T17:26:31-06:00", "id": 514397, "rating": 1, "commentid": 1558568, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Aliok", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Thousands of years ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Titans with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old Gods, he turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients. Among both mortals and dragons his name has become one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt.*\r\n\r\nHe created the artifact known as the Dragon Soul, which had great power. Driven mad by the Old gods, he used this to exact power over the \"lesser beings\", and the other dragon races. He also wiped almost all of the Blue Dragonflight out of existence.\r\n\r\nThe growing corruption in Neltharion's heart warped his body, as the angelic dragon began taking a more demonic appearance, similar to how Sargeras changed to a more demonic form after his corruption. Neltharion's body cracked open, revealing his molten heart, and magma and fire flowed off his chest. His eyes became aflame in red, demonstrating the magnitude of his power and the depths of his evil. Thus was Deathwing the Destroyer born, and the Dragon Soul was renamed: the Demon Soul.*\r\n\r\nDeathwing returned to his lair beneath a mountain. His proximity to the Demon Soul was ripping his body apart, so the goblins forged an armor of adamantium to serve as a vessel to contain Deathwing's raging powers and keep them in check. Only the adamantium plates kept the power from destroying his body. *\r\n\r\nMalfurion Stormrage used the Emerald Dream to find Deathwing's lair and stole the Demon Soul from the black dragon. After the Burning Legion was defeated, the Dragon Aspects sealed the Demon Soul with their energies, so that Deathwing should never be able to manipulate the Demon Soul. The artifact was hidden in an undisclosed location by Malfurion at the request of the Dragon Aspects. No longer in possession of the artifact and now unable to use it, Deathwing vowed to destroy most life and to wreak havoc on the planet. With his powers over earth, Neltharion caused volcanoes to rise along with the destruction already caused by the Well of Eternity's implosion, sinking most of Kalimdor below the ocean. *\r\n\r\nThe black aspect involved himself in Second War, adopting the form of Lord Daval Prestor, in order to destroy the Alliance from within. He also managed to turn his greatest enemy, Alexstrasza, into a slave of the Horde, with whom he later allied himself. After suffering a series of defeats culminating with his being chased off by the other Aspects, Deathwing retreated to the elemental plane Deepholm to recuperate. From Deepholm, Deathwing observed his former mate Sintharia's experiments with the twilight dragonflight in Grim Batol. Deathwing now continues his late consort's work.*\r\n\r\nDeathwing will make his return as the primary antagonist in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, the third expansion.Though long believed by most to be dead, Deathwing is regaining his strength in Deepholm and plotting a return that will shake Azeroth to its foundations.*\r\n\r\nDeathwing has control over the land and its fathoms, including lava. His main attack, and that of his dragonflight's, is to use his breath as a cannon of lava. He can live within volcanoes and high temperature areas.*\r\n\r\n* = From wowwiki.com (Article: http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing)", "date": "2010-08-26T16:17:29-05:00", "rating": 8, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
