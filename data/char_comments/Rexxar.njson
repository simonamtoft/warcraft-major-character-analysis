While other zones in Orgrimmar have multiple objectives / goals, [b]he is the lone objective of this \"Lost Area\"[/b]. Therefore, if you are managing your insanity, conserving orbs, or just generally looking to do a speed run for quest items; don't feel the need to pull/kill all of the mobs if you don't need to. There are videos available that show how to skip the vast majority of the mobs outside of Misha, Rexxar himself, and the mob just outside of Rexxar that guards the return Totem.[/li]\n[li]Rexxar sits towards the back of his hut, and there are several of his boars visible, although they do not start off in the fight. Rather, he calls them to service at certain point during the fight based on health % remaining.[/li]\n[li]Once the fight begins, Rexxar will toss [spell=304350] (Purple/Blue Circles) on the ground. Avoid these at all costs as they are a stun and sanity loss mechanic[/li]\n[li]As Rexxar's health depletes, he will call Boars at various points (Four of them based on health %) into the fight. These boars cast a pretty nasty sanity drain called [spell=304251]. They should be killed / focused immediately once they enter. If you go ham on Rexxar alone, all four boars will spawn as his health depletes, and be in the fight at the same time which can be problematic. First problem, it will really muddy up the area with various spells and auras thus making it difficult to see the traps and the adds that spawn in the next step, second it will become a huge sanity drain for you, third is that they do quite a bit of shadow damage.[/li]\n[li]As a part of going back and forth between the boars and Rexxar, he will then cast [spell=304282], which will then have little Sha' like minions going across the floor. You must avoid contact with these as they also do heavy shadow damage and are a pretty big sanity drain as well.[/li]\n[li]Once Rexxar dies, all of his adds will immediately disappear. Any zone related affixes will still be present though, so be wary of those.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[b]Tips: [/b]\n\n[ul]\n[li]Start the fight capped out on Insanity (~1000+) if possible. There are a lot of dynamics with this encounter, and if there is any interaction Orgrimmar that can cause failure and loss of a Horrific Vision; Rexxar is the one[/li]\n[li]Have all of your available CD's ready, all Buff's enabled (Flasks, Food, Etc...), and Potions ready if you have them.[/li]\n[li]Have a Weak Aura setup to show the Internal CD availability of [spell=307528]. You will want this to be ready and available at the start of the fight. As soon as the first boar is called to fight alongside Rexxar, solely focus this boar and kill it quickly. This will enable the vast majority of the time your [spell=307528] buff, and essentially give you 20 seconds to burn down Rexxar. [/li]\n[li]If you do not have the DPS to kill Rexxar in that 20 second window, do not forget to kill the other boars that enter the fight. [/li]\n[li]This fight can be made more difficult based on the Affixes/Madness that week (i;e [spell=306579], [spell=316557]). Be aware of those, and how those additional interactions will work coupled with the fight mechanics. Rexxar's hut is very small and confined, so the location combined with certain affixes can be a challenge.[/li]\n[li]Be especially careful if you are running with Masks enabled, as those are going to be additional mechanics that make the fight even more critical. There are 5 Masks available, and having all of them enabled essentially makes this an extremely difficult fight for some classes or spec.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[b]Additional Resources:[/b]\n\nOrgrimmar Guide - https://www.wowhead.com/guides/horrific-vision-of-orgrimmar-strategy-guide#comments:id=3194046 - Author: Sanghelios\nNPC & Buff Guide Orgrimmar - https://www.wowhead.com/news=311412/horrific-vision-of-orgrimmar-what-npcs-provide-buffs - Author: Squishei\nOdd Crystal Location Guide Orgrimmar - https://www.wowhead.com/news=311432/horrific-vision-of-orgrimmar-odd-crystals-details-and-hidden-locations - Author: Squishei\nBad / Good Potion Guide Orgrimmar - https://www.wowhead.com/news=311190/what-do-the-potions-do-in-horrific-visions-determining-the-bad-and-good-potions- - Author: Squishei", "date": "2020-03-12T09:52:34-05:00", "rating": 47, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Freaking died to him from full sanity twice and couldn't understand what I do wrong.

The orc had a special message for Thrall warchief of the horde and gave it to rexxar to give to Thrall. Rexxar then traveled to durotar in which the orcs were building the city Orgimmar. Rexxar gave the message to Thrall  and Thrall told Rexxar he was honored to have him and he could do anything he wanted in the city. But Rexxar was no freeloaded Rexxar told Thrall he would carry his own weight. Rexxar did some tasks for Thrall and his people. But then humans started attacking the orc encampments violating the alliance Jaina Proudmore made with the orcs long ago to defeat the demon Archimonde. Rexxar along with a troll scout went to Theramore Isle to ask Jaina why her forces tried to kill Thrall and his people. Jaina said she didnt know anything about it,but then Admiral Proudmore Jainas father came and revealed himself as the cause for this. Jaina tried to explain that the orcs had change they were there allies,but Admiral Proudmore didnt buy it. He kept sending forces to attack the orcs. Vol'jin son of Sen'jin told rexxar his troll scout to go ask the Tauren leader Carnie Bloodhoof and the ogres for help.But Carnie was very depressed he told Rexxar to tell Thrall he had died. Then Carnies advisors explains to Rexxar that Carnies son Baine Bloodhoof was taken by centaur. Rexxar and the troll scout went and rescued Baine. And Carnie was overflowed with joy,he told Rexxar to tell Thrall he and his people would surely aid him. Then they traveld to Dustwallow Marsh where the ogres lived.But to talk to the ogre leader Rexxar had to be a member of there clan. Since Rexxar was half ogre he was allowed to join. But he had to complete some tasks to become a member. Rexxar completed the tasks and talk to the ogre leader the ogre leader said they would never help weak orcs as long as he was leader. Rexxar challenged him to orc leader and came out victorious. The orcs along with the ogres and tauren went to Theramore Isle and killed Admiral Proudmore with Jainas help to. Jaina and he followers stayed allied with the orcs and stayed in theramore. Years later of the orcs and humans struggling to stay allies Rexxar came upon what he thought was a dead orc. The orc said he needed to get to Thrall. When they got there the orc told Thrall he had almost been killed by members of the burning blade. Rexxar Thrall and his advisors discussed it for a while.
