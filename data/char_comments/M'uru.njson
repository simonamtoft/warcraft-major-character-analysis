{"commentv2": 1, "number": 27, "id": 2299586, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Monlyth", "body": "The pre-nerf version of this fight is considered by many to be the hardest raid boss to ever make it to live servers, not counting bosses that were considered unkillable like Kael'thas, Lady Vashj and C'thun pre-nerf. It required near-best in slot gear, highly specific class stacking, profession stacking (Leatherworking for special Drums which buffed your DPS- and EVERYONE needed it), and near-perfect DPS and healing output from all players involved.\n\nThe reason? Incredibly tight DPS checks in both of the fight's two phases. In the first phase, the main threat is the adds: two groups of felblood elves, each consisting of two Shadowsword Berserkers and a Shadowsword Fury Mage, will periodically appear at the front and back doors of the boss's room. In addition to the elves, a Void Sentinel will periodically spawn in the room, which will split into multiple Void Spawns on death as well. Both the Shadowsword elves and the Void Sentinels were extremely dangerous and if you couldn't kill them before the next wave spawned, it was a wipe. The fact that you were dealing with all of these adds at once and also had to whittle away the boss's health at the same time made this phase a nightmare for even the best. In the second phase, he transforms into Entropius and inflicts gradually increasing damage to everyone in the raid, and you have to kill him before he kills you; most simply couldn't and consistently wiped at 15% or less.\n\nNow, all of these mechanics sound pretty simple, and wouldn't be so bad if the numbers were tweaked correctly. But because the health of M'uru, Entropius and all of the adds were so overtuned and because the damage they all inflicted to the raid was so high, keeping up on DPS and outhealing the damage required a combination of miracles, perfect rotations/coordination, and the aforementioned class and profession stacking. He was seriously not worth attempting if you didn't have 4-5 Shamans, 4-5 Warlocks, no more than 2 Mages, and an entire raid full of Leatherworkers.\n\nWhile he wasn't impossible to defeat, the hoops guilds had to jump through to even have a chance to defeat him and the endless frustration of wiping at 10% or less over and over broke up many raiding guilds and is one of the reasons almost no one saw the end of TBC's story in the Sunwell raid.\n\nPerhaps the most ironic part of this fight is that M'uru himself hardly does anything throughout the entirety of the fight; he just floats around and shoots shadow energy at random players in the first phase and is only deadly in the second phase because of the artificially-increasing raid damage he passively puts out.\n\nFew boss nerfs were as well-deserved as M'uru's in patch 2.4.3. Only the bosses that had NEVER been killed pre-nerf come close.", "date": "2016-01-18T08:19:06-06:00", "rating": 15, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2017-02-13T03:40:42-06:00", 1, "Monlyth"]}
