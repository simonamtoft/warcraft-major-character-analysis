{"commentv2": 1, "number": 1, "id": 1758380, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Iroared", "body": "A short guide for this boss (normal 10 man):\n\nOn the first phase you will fight the boss alone. Its main ability on this phase is [spell=123184], which creates two vortexes. The vortexes have 60 health, which indicates time until its explosion. Players standing inside the vortexes will not be able to receive healing, and any spells cast will reduce the vortex timer. Vortex explosion deals 200k physical damage to the whole raid.\nAdditionally, [spell=123792] will be cast on a random player, making it periodically damage all allies. Standing inside the vortex suppresses this damage, so players with the debuff should do so unless low on health (or if a vortex is about to explode). Additionally, they should cast some spells while in the vortex to desynchronize them so they don't explode at the same time.\nThe boss will also stack [spell=123707] on the current tank, so tanks should switch to avoid getting 5 stacks.\n\nWhen the boss energy reaches 0 (after 150 seconds), the boss retreats and summons minions. On each side, one [npc=63591] and three [npc=64453] will spawn, which have to be picked up by a tank. The minions buff each other's damage by 30% when standing close, so they should not be drawn together, and one minion has to be quickly killed on each side before the tanks run out of defensive cooldowns. The small adds sometimes cast whirlwind that does a lot of damage in melee range and should be interrupted, and the large add uses a large frontal cleave.\nSmall adds will also sometimes fixate on random players and follow them, just kite them until its over.\nBig adds have around 40 million health, so you should not waste damage trying to kill them. Instead, small puddles will appear on the ground, debuffing players that walk over them with [spell=124097]. When two players with this debuff come close, a larger puddle will appear, where additional debuffs can be dropped until the puddle forms a large trap. The large add should be brought into this trap (do not hesitate to walk over it, it doesn't work on players), where it will die. Small adds will attempt to break the trap, and should be killed at this point (do not kill them too early or you won't have enough resin for two traps; also, be careful not to trap them instead of the large add).\nAfter this phase, the boss will go back to phase one.\n\nWhen the boss reaches 30% health (ideally, after two phase one's and with only one add phase), phase three will begin. There shouldn't be any vortexes remaining (if there are, stop dps until they explode, there is always time to do so).\nEveryone should gather behind the boss in order to make it easier for healers to heal through the massive damage on this phase. In addition to casting [spell=123707] on the tank, and a few raid damage abilities, the boss will use two other abilities of note:\n[spell=124863]: places a debuff on two random players, and after 4 seconds these players will be feared and will start dealing damage to everyone around them. These players should quickly run out of the raid and get dispelled after 4 seconds.\n[spell=124849]: does a significant amount of damage and fears all players in a large cone, used in a random direction. Easy to avoid.\nThe only real difficulty with this phase is surviving the transition, healing in the phase itself doesn't seem to be too difficult.

Cry of Terror doesn't make you lose control of your character, you just do shadow damage to other players.  Doesn't even harm you.  I tried using the insignia as others suggest, thinking maybe it would allow me to break free of her chain fears (Visions of Demise).  It didn't.  The only thing that worked for me to break chain fears was my bubble, but unfortunately the bubble doesn't break Eye of the Empress stacks.  Which means as soon as you get charmed, the fight resets.  So the bottom line - if you are trying to solo this without pets, you can't do eet.  Because she won't summon the adds until her \"Boss Energy\" reaches 0, which takes 150 seconds by which time you are dead or the fight has reset.  If you are soloing this just to get through the instance, at lvl 910 you just nuke her.
