The adds assist you an enormous amount in this fight, and keeping them alive is a huge benefit to your raid. Once all four adds are freed, start DPSing Hodir. Beware of Icicles hitting people (there will be an animation that looks like snow raining down as a warning for incoming icicles) they hit for a decent amount of damage. Much like the Keristrasza fight, you will recieve a damaging debuff if you stand still, you can remove stacks by moving, or simply jumping. The Moonkin NPC will periodically spawn beams of light (similar to the ones spawned by the Lunar Festival items), standing in them will give you a 100% haste buff, so get into those if possible.\r\n\r\nA raid warning will call out when Hodir begins casting Flash Freeze, at which point two large, light blue circles will appear on the ground. DO NOT stand in these circles, until icicles have fallen on them to leave a clearly visible mound of snow. As soon as the snow mound appears, EVERYBODY (tank included) must stand on these mounds, or they will be encased in flash freezes, and must be broken out immediately. The NPCs will also be frozen, and should be freed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe other threat to this fight is Hodir's Frozen Blows ability. This weakens Hodir's physical damage considerably, however it adds a TON of frost damage to them. Have your frost resist tank taunt him IMMEDIATELY after gaining this buff. (On ten man with ~320 resist I was still getting hit extremely hard, so I recommend going to cap with your resist). The raid will take AoE damage which must be healed through during this phase (having raid members each wear a piece of frost resist is recommended to make it easier to heal through). When the buff is gone, the MT should taunt Hodir back immediately.\r\n\r\nThats as good of an explanation for the fight as I can give. All in all its not too bad of a fight.

Basic strategy applies to them as would in a normal 10 man or 25 man raid, minus the other people.\n\nHodir has an 8.12 mil health pool with a 9 minute enrage timer. He doesn't hit horrendously hard against a blood DK, pretty much everything he does is outhealable even without vampiric blood or other cooldowns. AMS is useful on for the freezes though. If you manage to pop AMS before freeze, it will prevent it from applying to you. If you pop AMS after freeze, it will prevent more stacks of biting chill, even though the damage from it is more or less neglible.\n\nIf you mess up on the flash freeze phase and get yourself frozen, hodir will break you out very quickly, although that's a few seconds you'll spend not killing him.\n\nThe friendly adds are quite helpful in this fight, assuming you bother to get them out. Stormcloud isn't useful since it really only affects people near you. I haven't seen Stormcloud hit a ghoul to transfer to me, but I'm not sure if it's possible.\nStarlight is +50% attack and casting speed. Quite useful if your DPS is a bit low.\nHaven't played around with Singed yet to see how it works from a DK point of view.\nAlso the dispells from the priests are handy, but she should be last on the order to get them out (Assuming you do.)\nRemember that if flash freeze hit a frozen add, [b]they will die.[/b]\n\nIf you're on the boss constantly, ignoring the adds, expect to need to do about 15.5k DPS to down him just before the enrage timer. If you're breaking the adds out, factoring in run time and all, expect something closer to 17.5k to bring him down in time.

Sometimes if you fail he frees you when he attacks you, but it happened to me once that he didn't and he just killed me slowly and took him 20 sec, lol. So better not taking risks and avoiding flash freeze, which also gives the achievement \"cheese the freeze\".\r\n\r\nTo do the other achievement, \"getting cold in here\", you must not get more than 2 stacks of biting cold, stacks are only given when you stand still, so as long as you keep moving and jumping you should not fail that, and if you're really going for that achi and you're not going to kill the boss without it, then save AMS for when he freezes you, so the stack doesn't go up if you AMS.\r\n\r\nIf you're only going for a kill, instead, better if you take 3-4 stacks of biting cold, then move, and bring them to 3 again, etc., they do exponential frost damage and more than enough to vengeance cap you.\r\n\r\nI personally don't free the npcs and don't have enrage problems.\r\n\r\nI also 3-manned the 25-man version (blood dk in dps gear 400 item level, ret paladin 380 or so, fire mage 390), and even here the only problem is the enrage, always a 8 mins enrage and while on 10 he has 8 millions, on 25 he has 32,4 millions, but he gives up at 500k or so, and you need like 66,6k group dps to kill him before he enrages, that's why we had our holy paladin go ret for this, since even if I was in full dps gear I could absorb 95% of his melee hits, only the frozen blows actually hit hard on 25, but there's AMS for that, so the paladin only healed himself and the mage with word of glory, and ofc used potions before pull, and again in fight, flasks, all possible buffs, it's probably the closest dps race in ulduar 25 with this setup.\r\n\r\nTime-warp at start, used every single cd, like rotting skull, dancing rune weapon, empower rune weapon every time it was ready and I had some vengeance, also used the ghoul for dps, since it was useless as a healing method, since I was full hp 95% of the time.\r\n\r\nFreeing the npc is not possible with so small groups, you would lose too much dps, BUT there are some specific npcs we had to free, the ones who give the stormcloud, which increased the critical strike damage by 135%, which resulted in some 230k death strikes, and already death strikes hit hard (over 100k), but this was a record.\r\n\r\nBarely made in time, he gave up at like 20 sec from enrage.\r\n\r\nAlso if no mistakes are made on it, it's possible to do \"cheese the freeze\" and \"getting cold in here\" 25 versions this way.

Hard Mode requires to kill Hodir within 3 minutes. There are 4 NPCs frozen in Ice Blocks, who can be freed by attacking the Ice Blocks. When freed, they will help you by attacking Hodir, casting spells to help you and providing beneficial buffs. To succeed you need to be always near the Starlight (beam) or Toasty Fire (campfire). In this fight you'll often run due to the Ice Shards falling from the ceiling and Biting Cold aura, so Kil'jaeden's Cunning talent is very useful here (I forgot to change talents -.-'). Unbound Will talent is very useful for dispelling Freeze (immobilization for 10sec similar to Frost Nova) after Flash Freeze (NPC, which removes it, will be frozen in Ice Block). When Hodir starts casting Flash Freeze, large icicle will begin to fall. The area where this icicle will fall is immediately marked by a mound of snow and a large white targeting circle on the ground. You should get next to, but NOT inside this large circle as soon as possible. After several seconds the large icicle will crash into the ground causing damage to anyone in the circle and knocking them 30 yards away. After the icicle has hit the ground, you have only a couple seconds to run into the circle where a large icicle has just fallen. Any NPCs who are not in large circle will be frozen in an Ice Block by the Flash Freeze (yes, you too). NPCs in Ice Blocks should be freed immediately prior to resuming dps on Hodir (I use DoTs). During Frozen Blows minion will need more healing.

The adds assist you an enormous amount in this fight, and keeping them alive is a huge benefit to your raid. Once all four adds are freed, start DPSing Hodir. Beware of Icicles hitting people (there will be an animation that looks like snow raining down as a warning for incoming icicles) they hit for a decent amount of damage. Much like the Keristrasza fight, you will recieve a damaging debuff if you stand still, you can remove stacks by moving, or simply jumping. The Moonkin NPC will periodically spawn beams of light (similar to the ones spawned by the Lunar Festival items), standing in them will give you a 100% haste buff, so get into those if possible.\r\n\r\nA raid warning will call out when Hodir begins casting Flash Freeze, at which point two large, light blue circles will appear on the ground. DO NOT stand in these circles, until icicles have fallen on them to leave a clearly visible mound of snow. As soon as the snow mound appears, EVERYBODY (tank included) must stand on these mounds, or they will be encased in flash freezes, and must be broken out immediately. The NPCs will also be frozen, and should be freed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe other threat to this fight is Hodir's Frozen Blows ability. This weakens Hodir's physical damage considerably, however it adds a TON of frost damage to them. Have your frost resist tank taunt him IMMEDIATELY after gaining this buff. (On ten man with ~320 resist I was still getting hit extremely hard, so I recommend going to cap with your resist). The raid will take AoE damage which must be healed through during this phase (having raid members each wear a piece of frost resist is recommended to make it easier to heal through). When the buff is gone, the MT should taunt Hodir back immediately.\r\n\r\nThats as good of an explanation for the fight as I can give. All in all its not too bad of a fight.
