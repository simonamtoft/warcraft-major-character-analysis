She is hinted to be the leader and most powerful of the Aspects, as her domain, life, encompasses four to a certain degree.\n\nAlexstrasza, also known as the Dragonqueen and the Great Red Leviathan, is one of the three Great Dragons who fought against the demons during the [url=?object=175727]War of the Ancients[/url]. Later, she helped create Nordrassil, the World Tree, by placing a magical acorn within the second Well of Eternity. For some time after, she and her fellow red dragons were at peace, but over time they began to argue about how best to shelter and protect the world. The rise to power of humans and other races left many believing that these new peoples were dangerous and should be destroyed, while others of Alexstrasza\u2019s ilk felt they should be educated to teach them right from wrong. When Alexstrasza later disappeared, the red dragonflight began a desperate search for her, only to fall prey to Deathwing\u2019s depredations. Those of the red dragonflight who survived eventually discovered that the orcs had captured their queen and were using her offspring as pawns in the Second War. Outraged, many of the red dragons wanted to make war against all the lesser races, but the rescue of Alexstrasza by [url=?npc=16128]Rhonin[/url] and his allies taught them that perhaps the ground-dwelling mortals could be good after all.\n\nAlexstrasza is supremely confident in her strength and righteousness. She does not seek out combat, but destroys only to punish or renew. In battle, she observes her foes carefully before striking at those she believes are the most deserving of her wrath. Enemies who flee when their leaders are defeated are generally allowed to escape, having learned a lesson they will not soon forget.\n\nShe's present in the new expansion Wrath of the Lich King, and leads the [url=?faction=1091]the Wyrmrest Accord[/url].

Their ability to stay warm in cold climates may have also been due to their very large size. The larger the animal, the higher it's ability to retain heat. Specifically in modern reptiles over 30 kg the rate of heat loss is about equal to that of mammals. This is known as gigantothermy. Sea turtles are the prime example of this, despite being cold-blooded, their ability to retain heat borders on the efficiency of that of endothermic animals.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jstor.org/pss/1444455\r\nhttp://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/Fitzpatrick/Gigantothermy.htm\r\n\r\nAnd best yet the actual lecture notes from my herp class in Spring 2008:\r\nhttp://www.inhs.illinois.edu/~chrisp/HerpLectures/HerpLec6.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the notes my professor explains that the strongest proponent for warm-blooded dinosaurs is a guy named Robert Bakker and he goes on to list Bakker's case for a warm-blooded dinosaur. (The notes are sort of lacking in text since my teacher was big on giving us mostly spoken info due to ppl skipping.) My professor explained that most of what Bakker holds as truth was initially accepted due to peaked interest but has since been generally thrown out by most of the paleontological community. Specifically the major \"consensus seems to be that most dinosaurs had neither \u201creptilian\u201d nor \u201cmammalian\u201d physiology, but something in between - inertial homeothermy.\"(Phillips 2008) Inertial homeothermy is another way of saying gigantothermy.\r\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the specifics on Linnaean classification of dinosaurs as reptiles, that is a gray area I'd rather not venture into since it involves a times when phylogenetic trees were just beginning to bud. Hell, the modern grouping of 'reptile' as a category isn't even scientifically accurate since it's paraphyletic. (The only way to make it monophyletic is if we included birds!)\r\n\r\nDon't mess with the Bio majors that play this game. Had to learn waaay more of this than I cared to in my herpetology course. ;) It's also fascinating, but I might be a little biased.\r\n\r\nEdit: Changed polyphyletic to paraphyletic.[/quote]\r\n\r\n...what?", "date": "2009-09-13T19:47:49-05:00", "rating": 43, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

You get introduced to the major players of the Red dragons: Baleflame, a dragonkin who appears to be a commander or something similar, an old dragon named Caelstraz who you may remember as the night elf from AQ40, and a drake in elven guise that hates your guts named Lirastaza. After securing their trust by pushing back the Twilight drakes and cultists, you see Alex challenge Deathwing to a fight. He comes, showing he has fallen farther than ever before \"Behold the power bestowed apon me by this worlds TRUE MASTERS!\" (he temporarily has Old God tentacles coming out his back). They face eachother in midair combat while you and the reds fend off more Twilight drakes. Both eventually fall to the ground, but Alex has lost while Deathwing appears to be stronger than ever, fire spouting from his body like never before. While you carry the wounded dragon queen away (shes in her mortal form), Calen stays behind to slow Deathwing down. He apparently survived and helps you against Sintharia in the Bastion of Twilight heroic-mode. Afterward, she makes the difficult decision of ordering a genocide of the Black dragons, for if they are not stopped, all Azeroth will die, Deathwing's cursed flight must fall for the greater good. \r\nShe is, however, apparently intersted in restarting the black dragonflight from scratch, evidenced by the quests in Badlands involving the dragon named Rhea/Rehastraza using Titan-technologies to purify the taint of the Old Gods from black dragon eggs.", "date": "2011-02-09T23:52:26-06:00", "rating": 6, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-02-09T23:53:13-06:00", 1, "sitecow09"]}

He was a paladin who ventured into Draenor and helped seal the Dark Portal to keep malevolent forces from reaching Azeroth, around the same time Ner'zhul escaped. His whereabouts remain unknown since the event. His wife, Alleria (also missing) is the sister of the Silver Covenant's leader, a connection which would ease the information into the current storyline assuming both their fates are discovered in WotLK.\r\n\r\nThere was speculation that Turalyon's fate may have been bound to that of Deathwing, who was rumored to also dwell in Outland. However, with the release of the new novel, Night of the Dragon, it's confirmed that he resides below Grim Batol.\r\n\r\n2. Arthas' child. There is the slight possibility that Jaina and Arthas had a secret lovechild before his venture to Northrend. The child may have been raised as a paladin or through paladin teachings/training, and kept hidden following the devastation of Lordaeron and Quel'thalas. Should the Lich King discover Arthas had a child, he would send his forces immediately to the remaining continents in an effort to kill it and reinforce his control over Arthas' soul, assuming Arthas' consciousness is not fully lost and can be awakened by such a revelation.\r\n\r\n/snork", "date": "2009-01-18T23:10:49-06:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "If #2 turns out to be true, I would believe Blizzard is adding a 'Star Wars' storyline to the game ([b]possible [b]SPOILERS[/b] to Star Wars fans[/b]):    1.

She's never done it before. Only Nozdormu can do that, and he wouldn't. As for anyone who will say \"lolnubthisiswowpaladinsandshamansandwhathaveyoucanrezandstuff\"... shut the hell up. It doesn't work that way, and you *should* know it. There are a bunch of people Alexstrasza could have resurrected, like Tyranastrasz for example, but she never did. Resurrection isn't really possible in Warcraft, except under special conditions, and is only available as a mechanic in the games for purposes of playability.\r\n\r\nBolvar was afflicted by the Forsaken's so-called New Plague, that is effective against both the living and the Scourge. The Red Dragonflight purged the land, presumably killing any raised warriors and cleansing the Plague. Then again, it might not have succeeded completely, and Bolvar may now be a Death Knight. Saurfang was not referenced because everyone saw the Lich King steal his soul, he's more or less a canon Death Knight now anyway. In this case, the 'young Paladin' mentioned could very well be Bolvar. \r\n\r\nGiven that, it should be easy to realize that, once the possibility of the quote referring to Bolvar is established, it becomes a fact. Why? Because in that context, nothing else makes sense. Bolvar was the only important 'young Paladin' in the events of the Wrathgate whose fate might interest us and there could be a valid reason to keep it hidden. For Alexstrasza to be discussing another, completely random Paladin at that very same scene... come on. \r\n\r\nAs for Arthas, he may yet be redeemed, although I have conflicting views on that[/quote]\r\n\r\nActually if you read a certian scarlet onsluaghts high generals diary some individuals can and have been resurected many. many times.

[s]Comparing [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Ner%27zhul]Ner'zhul[/url] to [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Arthas_Menethil]Arthas [/url]is like comparing the world's greatest hacker to the computer chair he's sitting in.[/s] Ner'zhul was the orc shaman who [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Kil%27jaeden]Kil'jaeden[/url] made into the Lich King; he later manipulated Arthas into his champion - pretty much a glorified puppet - and later possessed Arthas' body after his prison was breached in [i]The Frozen Throne[/i]. \n\nThe NPCs in the game aren't totally aware of what happened to Arthas so they keep calling him 'Arthas'[s] even though the prince has pretty much left the building. The players have access to better information than they :P[/s] \n\n[b]The original take was that[/b] both Ner'zhul and Arthas shared Arthas' body and the Lich King has Arthas' personality and mannerisms but Arthas isn't in charge here.\n\n[b]Now, the upcoming Lich King novel has basically retconned the lore, establishing that Arthas [u]is[/u] in control. Sheesh.[/b]\n\n[s]Second,[/s] [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=28859]Malygos [/url]is as close to a [i]brother[/i] as we can get for Alexie, since the five Dragon Aspects ruled the world before any of the sapient mortal races even knew themselves. And she [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=4500]didn't hold back against [i]him[/i][/url], since that's what was needed to end the threat to the world. I don't think she'd pull her punches against the Lich King because she 'pities' him. There would have to be something else.\n[s]\nLastly,[/s] [b]A[/b]s much as I like the old orc (Ner'zhul), he doesn't come anywhere near Alexstrasza. \n\nThe closest thing to an 'avatar of death' on Azeroth is [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing]Neltharion[/url] himself - [u]Deathwing[/u] - father of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=11583]Nefarian[/url], father of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10184]Onyxia[/url], leader of [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Black_Dragonflight]the Black Dragonflight[/url], ancestor of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?faction=1015]the Netherwing flight[/url] and the one dragon able to challenge the good Aspects. He may not be into necromancy and undeath in the same way as the Lich King but he [i]is[/i] the archenemy of Alexstrasza and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=31334#comments]her consort[/url].\n\nEDIT: Linkified and more precise. Enjoy.\n\nEDIT 2: New developments have been introduced via the \"Rise of the Lich King\" novel, which does away with Ner'zhul as the major power and claims that after a grueling fight for his body, Arthas actually managed to defeat the more powerful, more experienced orc spirit. Hey, I'm not the author here, just the messenger.\n\nEDIT 3: And oh look, the upcoming expansion is all about Deathwing. w00t :D Incidentally, I'd considered that as a possibility and [url=http://www.freewebs.com/kadirsilvermace/kablogvolumeii.htm?blogentryid=4490589]made a faux script for a trailer for it[/url].", "date": "2009-04-01T06:04:30-05:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-11-23T10:11:29-06:00", 11, "TriniKrusader"]}

Believe it or not, if there was something she could do to stop it she would have most likely done it. Sure, the dragonmaws had help from Deathwing and a very powerful and ancient artifact, but surely the most powerful being in Azeroth should be able to resist that, don't you think? \r\n\r\nSecondly, you can define power in several different ways. As for destructive powers, I think that either Deathwing or Malygos might be a bit more powerful in those areas. She is supposed to be the aspect of [i]life[/i], it would make no sense if she harbored more destructive powers than the aspect of [i]magic[/i] (clearly very destructive, magic is most commonly used to cause damage) or the aspect of [i]death[/i] (well, he wasn't originally known as that but even if he was still known as [i]Neltharion, the Earth Warder[/i], I'm guessing that earth and stone is still a bit more destructive than life).
