When we did that, we were not using vent and the gear of the group ranged from people with lots of epics to people who just got 70\n\n3- Right when you start the fight, he will spawn tons of adds + the 4 guards standing next to him, and like all city bosses, you should bring a members who can AoE, and if possible, a Paladin to AoE tank the adds (in this case, it was me, i am Ret but was using a shield to aoe tank, they don't hit hard, but can be a pain in the ass if ignored)\n\n4- After you kill all the adds, time to focus on the boss. First, you don't have to be specced to tank, his hits are REALLY low, 500 - 800 in plate, the only \"problem\" of this fight is that he casts some sort of aoe Holy Smite (Priest's Smite, but instead of hitting one single target, hits the entire raid), so the Healers must pay attention to that\n\n5- From time to time, He will kick the main tank and start attackingthe second on the aggro list, that's why you need 2 tanks.\n\n6- After awhile, Velen spawn another \"wave\" of adds, just aoe the guards down\n\n\nI hope you enjoy the fight, it took us 3 attempts, because we were not expecting adds on the first time, and on the second time, we only had 12 players and we were not that organized.\nAfter we downed him, we went to Darnassus to kill Tyrande and the Druid :)", "date": "2007-08-26T15:40:56-05:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah and we killed thrall,voljin,cairne and sylvanas while u were there!", "creationdate": "2010-07-02T01:53:40-05:00", "id": 453534, "rating": -7, "commentid": 144404, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "224480", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "So you killed an old man who's spent thousands of years figuring out how we can all defeat the Legion?

I tanked hm on the platform with my back to the wall so that I would not get thrown. AOE pulled all adds to me as they spawned and Boomkin burned them down. Whenever he kicked me, I would just taunt him again to pull him off the Boomkin. The only issue was Boomkin going OOM because the battle went so long. Healer was able to keep the tank up easilly and still wand the boss most of the time. Note, this probably would have been completely impossible if we'd been attacked by allies. But as far as the NPC and his guards go its doable with a single group (obviously).\r\n\r\nThis was not a planned event.

Magni, you have called this meeting.  What concerns you?[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45666]King Magni Bronzebeard[/url]: You've no doubt noticed the string of earthquakes we've had in the last weeks.  Something doesn't feel right about them.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41710]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/url]: What do you mean?[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: We dwarves have a connection to the earth.  We can feel her pain.  And right now the earth is crying out.  These earthquakes... they are both natural and not.  I wanted to gather you all together and discuss them.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45776]Tyrande Whisperwind[/url]: Even in Darnassus we have noticed the earth is at odds with something.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: I've received word from my brother Brann in Northrend.  In his exploring of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/zone=4273]Ulduar[/url] he came across some unusual tablets... something ancient.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Nothing good has come from that dreadful place.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: This might just change your mind.  Brann is shipping the tablets to me as we speak. Preliminary reports from the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Explorers'_League]Explorers' League[/url] state that they may be able to help us understand what is going on with the earthquakes.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45667]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/url]: Our top minds have been looking into the seismic activities... Well, we've mostly been looking at how to secure a building's frame while at the same time simulating tectonic shifts...[/li]\r\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: ...because on the one hand, this could be a handy device, the \"Shake-a-Ton 2000.\"  But on the other hand, the last thing we gnomes want to see is the mountains of Dun Morogh collapse and crush Ironforge.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: So is that why you have moved out?[/li]\r\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: Ha, not at all!  Though it is a striking coincidence.  Gnomeregan has been and continues to shame our people.  It is long past time we reclaim our homeland.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Well, it is good that things have turned out... better for you and your people, High Tinker.  But not all of us have the luxury of up and moving our kingdom.[/li]\r\n[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=45774]Prophet Velen[/url]: And those that did know how dangerous these earthquakes can be.  To this day, the Exodar is still shaking from our rather abrupt arrival.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I'm not certain we could organize our people to move even if we wanted to.  We've also received word of hostile elementals appearing randomly across the lands, sometimes in towns, sometimes across the countryside.  Moving may not be an option.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: Well, there is at least a wee bit of good news... no offense, Gelbin.  The shaking seems to have stirred up [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Earthen_Ring]The Earthen Ring[/url].  Even the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=39055]Wildhammer shaman[/url] have offered their help.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Perhaps these events are also what have brought forth the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Highborne]Highborne[/url] from [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Shen%27dralar]Shen'dralar[/url].[/li]\r\n[li][b]Prophet Velen[/b]: It seems as if this world is coming apart at the seams.  I've seen these symptoms before, on Draenor... We may not be able to stop this.  Fleeing may be our best option.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: Fleeing is not an option I wish to entertain at this point. We will find another way.  Perhaps these tablets from Ulduar will shed some light on our situation.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: Hopefully we can get these answers quickly.  The [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40125]people[/url] are frightened, and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40124]cultists[/url] are taking advantage of that fear.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Varian Wrynn[/b]: These cultists only exacerbate the problem.  They preach the end of the world, or that the world is having birthing pains... Hyperbole that is hard for the populace to ignore.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Tyrande Whisperwind[/b]: Troubling times indeed. Fear of the unknown makes people do foolish things.[/li]\r\n[li][b]High Tinker Mekkatorque[/b]: And our lack of answers only fuels the confusion.[/li]\r\n[li][b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]: All the more reason we need to reach the bottom of this.  This tablet from Ulduar will lead us in the right direction.  Brann is sure of it.  And if Brann is certain, then I am certain.[/li]\r\n[li][b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]: I've made it a point not to argue with a dwarf when it comes to the earth.  If the [url=http://www.wowpedia.org/Bronzebeard_clan]Bronzebeards[/url] are sure this tablet will help solve the earth's problems, then by all means we should support them.[/li]\r\n[/ul][/quote]", "date": "2010-11-01T20:47:08-05:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

This version of Velen appears in Swamp of Sorrows when you complete a series of quests. A draenei tries everything to save his sick Broken friend, Magtoor, from dying. But despite everything Magtoor dies. Velen ports in from the Exodar to tell the draenei and the player that they did their best, and the Light does not wish harm on anyone. \"Not all who wander are lost.\"", "creationdate": "2012-07-26T01:08:09-05:00", "id": 559371, "rating": 2, "commentid": 1601498, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 256, "username": "Reignac", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-12-24T19:34:40-06:00", 1, "cjuncloned"]}
