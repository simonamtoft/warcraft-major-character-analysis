Closest ones first. Use knockbacks & stuns. Death grip also works.\n\nPhase 2\n\nSulfuras Smash remains from Phase 1, lava traps and knockback are gone.\n-Split raid on both sides of room, empty in middle.\n-Dont stand in Engulfing Flames\n-When Ragranos uses Molten seeds, move to the center, pop survivability cooldowns and aoe until the adds that spawn are dead. During second seeds, you will get Sulfuras Smash at the same time. Easiest way to deal with this is to go close to the edge of Raggy's pool and the smash will simply go over you.\n\nTransition 2\n\n-Kill adds before they reach the hammer, just like in transition 1.\n-2 big adds spawn in addition to smaller adds. Burn these while moving them around, if you get the debuff, move anywhere where ANY of the adds are not moving towards.\n-Small adds > Big adds.\n\nPhase 3\n\nSulfuras Smash and  Engulfing Flames will remain from previous phases.\n-Living Meteors will spawn continually, which follow players around and kill them (and anyone nearby) if they reach them. Attack the meteors to knock them back. Split the raid in half like in p2 and knock the meteors toward the middle. Once there are too many meteors, start kiting them if needed.\n-If the meteors hit lava waves, [i]something [/i]happens to them. As far as I know, its only for the sake of the achievement.\n\nHeroic:\n\nP1:\n\n-Similar to normal. Time magma traps carefully to prevent any deaths.\n\nTransition 1:\n\n-Same as normal, except different spawn locations (?). The more death grips/typhoons etc. you have, the better.\n\nP2: \n\n-Easiest way to handle Molten Seeds is to group up in mid, wait for them to start flying in the air, then have EVERYONE move away. No one takes damage, all the seeds are clustered, but timing is crucial. Simply aoe/typhoon them down afterwards. If not working, simply single target them down. Will take longer though.\n-Engulfing flames comes 4 times in a row for 3 seconds at each part, stand near the edges everytime to prevent unneeded damage/deaths.\n\nTransition 2:\n\n-Same as normal/transition 1, remember no failing with the debuff! If possible, keep one son of flame up while you kill scions. \n\nP3: \n\n- Heroism either as soon as raggy comes up or after scions are dead. Same as normal + the new engulfing flames. \"Chill time\" before P4 considering tactics. HUGE dps requirement. 140 seconds to go from 40->10% to avoid extra living meteors from spawning. If Scions are still up when raggy comes back, only cleave them down. All DPS needs to focus rag.\n\nEdit: With the nerfed HP, you can hit P4 with just one meteor.

Max 8 players per group (should be 7. Thats for 25, 10man is ez), triangle style on the edges.

Tanks must switch off near 3-4 stacks and use cooldowns towards the end of their turn.\nEvery 30 seconds, Ragnaros will cast Sulfuras Smash. He will face a random player and hit the area they were standing in after two seconds of cast time. The location of the smash is given away by three lava pools formed together on the spot. When the cast is finished, three lava waves will spawn and move in different directions. (one is in the direction the boss was facing, and the other two will be to the perpendicular sides.) The locations of these smashes will always be within an arc just barely past the edge of the platform in front of Ragnaros. They are easily avoidable by standing diagonal to the direction of the smash or close-up to the boss. Touching the lava wave will knock back the player and place a strong magic DoT on them which will kill them if not dispelled immediately.\nRagnaros will also randomly burst the entire raid, knocking them back a few yards. (Similar to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=46753]Al'Akir[/url]'s [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=93261]Wind Burst[/url] but without a cast time.) Players should not be near the edge of the platform or they will get knocked off into the lava. Players must also be aware of this knockback possibly due at the same time a Sulfuras Smash occurs so they do not accidentally get knocked into the lava waves or a trap. [i]This mechanic only occurs during Phase 1.[/i]\nRanged must be fully spread out as a random ranged player will be targeted with a trap on the ground that will damage the entire raid when triggered. It will remain there for the entire fight unless it is activated by a player moving into it. Warlocks with Demonic Portals, Mages with Slowfall, or Priests with Levitate can trigger these without dying. [b]However,[/b] they must be sure the entire raid is topped before doing so as this combined with Ragnaros' random burst will kill someone who is not fully healed.\n\n[b]Phase 1.5[/b]\nAt 70%, Ragnaros will face a random direction in front of him and throw down Sulfuras before submerging. Eight fire elemental adds will spawn in static locations around the perimeter of the platform. If any one of these elementals touches Sulfuras, they will cast [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=100260]Supernova[/url] and blast your entire raid for a lot of damage. This will wipe your raid if you are not fully topped. They start with a movement speed increase which will decrease as their health lowers to 50%. All melee should be separated to their own assigned add to stunlock and burn it down while ranged finish off all adds prioritized by whichever is closest to Sulfuras. These adds cannot be rooted or snared, but they [b]can[/b] be [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=49576]Death Gripped[/url], and knocked back with [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=50516]Typhoon[/url]. When all adds have died or 45 seconds have elapsed in this phase, Ragnaros will reemerge. \n\n[b]Phase 2[/b]\nRagnaros uses a new ability which will also be used in Phase 3. Engulfing Flames will be cast for 3 seconds on a third of the room (separated in lanes: melee, middle, ranged)\nEvery 60 seconds, Ragnaros will spawn lava seeds on random players within the raid. All players must be spread out to avoid the splash damage these seeds cause when placed but remain on one side of the room before they are placed. After all seeds are placed, players must cross over to the other side immediately before these seeds detonate. Damage from all the seeds are based on proximity, so the closer the deadlier. After the explosion, adds will spawn for each one of these seeds and target random players. The raid must stack up to AoE all these adds down before spreading back out for the next wave of seeds. The raid can stack anywhere, but it would be easiest to do so on top of the tank at the very front of the platform to avoid being caught off guard by Sulfuras Smash. However, if any players stagger and are too far back they are likely to get instantly killed by Sulfuras Smash. \n\nThe biggest part of this phase is being in the right place at the right time. When a Sulfuras Smash or Engulfing Flames occurs, players must remain at least 6 yards away from each other when Lava Seeds are coming. These two abilities will also occur when players are stacking up to AoE adds so they must be aware of them coming. The abilities used in this phase are static and sequential, so it's easy to memorize what will happen when. (e.g. Every second lava seed spawn having a Sulfuras Smash happen right after the explosion)\n\n[b]Phase 2.5[/b]\nStarts at 40% HP. The exact same as Phase 1.5 with the addition of two Lava Scions, each one spawning on separate sides of the room which must be tanked. All players must kill their elemental adds quickly as before with the exception of the furthest one to buy time to kill both Lava Scions before Ragnaros reemerges. Chain grips and knockbacks on the last add to use the full duration of the phase while burning down one of the scions to free a tank for Ragnaros in Phase 3. \n\n[b]Phase 3[/b]\nSulfuras Smash and Engulfing Flames are still used in this phase. Very large meteors will now start spawning as a soft enrage in this fight to chase random players. The spawn location is given away with a graphic similar to Hellfire which everyone nearby must move away from. They are extremely slow, and can be knocked back every 5 seconds by doing direct damage to them. However, it should only be hit if it's in danger of touching the player. Meteors do not stay on the same player and may switch to a different one at any time, so it's important to keep distance from all active meteors. Collision with the meteor will cause it to explode, killing the colliding player and everyone within 8 yards. As this phase persists, meteors will keep spawning and chasing more players so Ragnaros must be killed as fast as possible.\n\nAt 10% HP, Ragnaros retreats and awaits you to defeat him on Heroic.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] Changed tank info & last line.", "date": "2011-06-30T14:53:54-05:00", "rating": 60, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You are wrong about the tank switching...the debuff only lasts 20 seconds, so it's normally done at 3-4 stacks.

The enrage timer is 12 minutes. Ragnaros hits hard on tanks.\n\nThe following two abilities will persist throughout the whole fight aside from the two transition phases where he will be submerged.\nSulfuras Smash will happen, an ability that will show up as 3 circles clumped together on the ground, and smash his hammer on the specified location. Getting hit by the direct ability is a one shot. 3 lava waves will spew out from where the hammer hit, much like Sartharion's lava walls except much smaller but faster. The directions that the walls spawn from will be from the tip of the specified location (outwards pointing to the nearest edge of the platform) and the two sides. It will never point towards Ragnaros himself and will always point in the same directions. If you do happen to get hit by the lava walls, it will hit for about moderate damage and apply a dot on you which needs to be dispelled. It is completely avoidable and should be. Also note that the area where he smashed his hammer will have a ground effect AoE which will do some damage.\nAnother ability Ragnaros does is a stacking DoT called Burning Wound on the tank, this is basically a tank swap. Tanks should taunt immediately after their stacks fall off, as it has a 20 second duration. A tip for the pull is to let the main tank use his threat CD's, and once it wears off tank two taunts to maximize TPS. After that both tanks should taunt off each other immediately.\n\nPhase 1: 100%-70%\n\nDuring phase 1 he will cast hand of Ragnaros, knocking back all players in range of him and do a small amount of damage that cannot be avoided unless ranged (don't bother, you'll have to be off the platform completely).\n\nHe will also cast wrath of Ragnaros and blast a random raid member and inflict moderate damage, blasting them backwards. Basically spread out to avoid multiple players getting hit.\n\nThese two abilities are similar to Al'akir's wind burst.\n\nThe key ability in phase 1 that Ragnaros will use is magma trap, but unlike shadow trap on Lich King this trap will need to be activated or else you will have multiple traps on the platform which will make things chaotic in phase 3. The initial cast will look like a orange swirly heading towards the direction (underneath a player) and needs to be avoided. It will also have a ground effect similar to a shadow crash on general Vezax in Ulduar or the trash packs before the last boss in OK.\nWhen the trap gets detonated, it will do moderate damage to the entire raid. Think of a crackle except less deadly but more often.\nThe way you handle these traps before they get overwhelming is to send a capable ranged player to step on these traps to detonate. You do not get any parachute or slow fall of what sort by default, so you must use a class's ability, such as Slow fall from priests, Blink from mages, disengage from hunters, etc. Coordinate with your healers when you do this, a badly timed detonate may cause a lot of strain or a death.\nTanks should use a CD when the trap gets detonated, Shield wall, BH trinket, anything that reduces damage is great as you won't have a chance to use them much unless healers are falling behind.\n\nThe combination of the multiple knock backs, magma traps, and sulfuras smash can be deadly at times, as if you get knocked back into either a trap, smash, or lava wave it can be a bad start.\n\nPhase 1.5: the phase shift\n\nDuring this phase, Ragnaros himself will not do any damage to tanks, and there not be much damage coming out to the raid. This is ideal time to regenerate mana for healers.\n\nRagnaros will once again, smash his hammer on the ground but will not cause any lava waves. You can tell where his hammer is going to be placed from the 8 beams that will be visible, indicating where 8 adds will spawn. He can place his hammer on the left side, center, or middle. You can tell where it will be before he places them. If 2 beams are to the left and 6 to the right, the hammer will be placed on the left. If it is split (4:4) it will be in the center. If 6 beams are to the left and 2 to the right, it will spawn to the right. These adds don't have any threat and dps may wish to dps as they please. These adds are considered elementals and paladins should glyph into holy wrath to stun them because of the following reason.\nWhen the elementals reach the hammer, it will cause about 100k damage and can easily be a wipe. If everyone is at full HP, a wipe can be prevented but don't expect it. Just kill them before they reach the hammer. The key thing about these adds is the lower their HP is, the slower they are until they're at a point where they move like a snail. To prevent any speedy runs to the hammer, stun them as soon as they come out with a long stun, such as Concussion blow, Hammer of Justice, etc. Split up DPS, with 2 on the left, 2 on the right, and your most capable DPS in the center. DK's can death grip them if one's getting dangerously close, and knock backs work, but aren't recommended for the [b]second[/b] transition.\nWhen the adds die, they'll explode but it's best to have melee stick on them and heal through the small damage.\nDo not leave a Son of Flame active as if Ragnaros comes back up and ones still alive he'll instantly wipe the raid.\n\nPhase 2: 70%-40%\n\nRagnaros will emerge again, but this time there will be no more knock backs, and no more traps. Instead introduced are two new mechanics. \n\nThere will be Engulfing Flames, similar to Valiona's engulfing flames which cover one third of the ground towards the end of Theralion's ground phase.\nTanks must always be in melee range or Ragnaros will start casting on you, which is a lot more damage than melee. The engulfing flame makes it hard to stay in melee range. I found the initial flame easy to avoid but died to the ground effect after. If you look closely at the flames, you will see that they are many circles on the ground that makes it, making a long chain of circles of fire. If you stand in between a circle's top and another circle's top, you can just get in enough for melee range. If you have graphics turned on and you are comfortable then you may not need to do this.\nAnother ability he will cast is Molten seeds. These seeds will spawn on players and do moderate AoE damage. Spread out. The key to this is that because when the seeds explode and do damage, the farther away you are the less damage it'll do. Pretty much have all the players spread out on the right and left sides of the whole platform, no one should be standing in the middle. The tricky part about spreading out is that you will sometimes have an engulfing flame right before seeds, making it tricky to spread after the engulfing flames before the seeds. The same goes for Sulfuras Smash's lava walls.\nWhen the seeds blow up, it is a good time to use raid CD's, AMZ is amazing, AM from holy paladins, DG, RC, SLT, and PW:B are all great for this as you will be stacking for when they do. The reason you want to stack is because after the seeds blow up, adds spawn with low HP and they need to be AoE'd down, a tank cannot pick them up as after spawning they fixate on someone. Best for groups with hunters is to stun all the adds and let them go out to AoE. When the stuns wear off hopefully they're all dead.", "date": "2011-07-05T09:55:32-05:00", "rating": 34, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-07-05T10:18:36-05:00", 2, "Manbewbs"]}

When Sulfuras Smash happens, just tuck in further into Ragnaros, making sure you're not standing in lava as there's a little gap between him and the hammer.\nAfter they're all dead, rinse and repeat. We found the first and third stack \"phase\" to be Engulfing Flames, and the second one the Smash. We did not get a fourth one so I cannot comment on it, although it's logical it is a Smash.\n\nPhase 2.5: transition phase\n\nExact same as the first transition aside from one new debuff and a new type of add, Blazing Trail, if it's on a player it will leave a fire trail on the ground and if you stand still with the debuff you will be standing in the stacking fire, obviously not good. This fire trail also heals the little elemental adds, thus making them faster and most likely making a wipe. Stand on the edge of the platform and DPS adds from behind to negate the risk of them healing.\nA new type of an add spawns that have a lot more HP (2 million ish I think?) that must be tanked and killed. The second transition is ideal to pop Bloodlust/Heroism to get these adds down, though prioritizing little adds over large ones. They spawn from the black circles (rock formation on the ground all throughout the encounter). Burn them down once the adds are dead.\nThese adds are tauntable and should be to switch off on Burning stacks of Ragnaros through phase 3.\n\nPhase 3: 40%-10%\n\nEngulfing Flames still persist from phase two during phase three. There is a new mechanic introduced again, this time a flaming Meteor. These Living Meteors have a lot of HP and should not be killed. When they spawn a small hellfire will indicate the location. This meteor will fixate on a random member, not the tanks as far as I saw, and follow them. A yellow line will be connecting the player and the meteor, and the player will have a yellow arrow above their head. If this does reach you, you will explode the meteor, one shot anyone near you and yourself, and get blown off. Luckily you can avoid it reaching you by damaging the meteor and it will knock it back from the player that damaged it. Shortly after it will fixate on a different player and start again. You cannot spam knock him back though, as it gets a debuff after you knock it which prevents it from being knocked back for 5 seconds.\nDuring this phase more and more meteors will spawn until you eventually become overwhelmed.\nHealers should hit the boulder themselves with Moonfire, SW:D, Judgement, or Earth Shock.\n\nThat pretty much concludes my in depth explanation for Ragnaros!

In terms of placement, first we tried gathering in a circle around the center using the floor pattern as a guide.  In later attempts we tried stacking on one side of the room and running to the opposite side.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, if we got Engulfing Flames in the center of the room at the same time as the seeds, it was pretty much a wipe since the ranged and tanks were divided and unable to stack for healing and damage reduction - especially if we were using the circle strategy.  EF was particularly annoying for the 2nd seed when the room would get divided by flames, followed by seed, followed by the hammer wave.  No matter which configuration we used it ended badly.  Are you just screwed if you have seeds and a center EF at the same time?\r\n\r\nGoing back to formations, using the center worked decently until EF divided the room and no one could stack anymore.  So we tried stacking the raid on a side and then moving to the other as we got seeds.  This seemed like a messier approach since people were scattered in terms of how far they had crossed the room by the time the seeds went off, so that heals and damage reductions weren't getting everyone.  Is there a minimum damage dealt by the seeds so that there's a distance we should have been stopping at sooner?  We also still had a difficulties with the EF again, and getting everyone to the front on the 2nd seed to avoid the hammer.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on formations and how to deal with EF/seed at the same time would be *greatly* appreciated!

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 27, "id": 1536311, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "citrique", "body": "Heroic is a somewhat different encounter than normal, especially after the rather sweeping nerfs to the normal version.\n\nOur guild ended up 3-healing the 25-man version of the encounter for a kill.\n\nPhase 1 is mostly the same. The major differences are that detonating a Magma Trap causes everyone in the raid to receive a Magma Trap Vulnerability debuff which causes them to take 50% additional damage from detonated traps for 45 seconds. What this means is that you cannot detonate a trap for 45 seconds afterward, causing you to slowly accumulate additional traps that will persist after the phase has ended. Ideally this number will be as close to 0 as possible, in our case it was 1.\n\nWhat we did was had ranged DPS mostly stay on the left side of the boss along with the tanks, with melee on the right so they could DPS the boss from behind and avoid parries. A couple ranged (with legendaries) stood behind the melee on the right. A shaman healed the melee group solo. When the third and fourth traps were about to be cast, ranged DPS would venture towards the back of the platform to cause the trap to spawn there, then move back in so Hand of Ragnaros could not knock them off. The trap(s) which persists beyond phase 1 needs to be placed as close to the edge as possible so it is avoidable and out of the way for subsequent phases. If it is placed close enough to the edge of the platform, it can be ignored for the remainder of the fight.\n\nDPS in phase 1 is primarily focused on pushing the transition before you get a fifth trap. Otherwise DPS doesn't matter an awful lot and a focus on survivability is best taken.\n\nDuring the P1-P2 transition, the major difference is that Sons of Flame reaching the hammer will instantly wipe the raid upon detonation (400K damage or so) and they have a huge amount more health. We assigned Death Knights to grip Sons closest to the hammer on the \"long\" side of a split (hammer to the left or right) with moonkin/ele shaman knockbacks for the \"short\" side. The transition phase is the roughest for healers with lots of random damage from Lava Bolts. Tranquility was used to catch up at the end of the phase before Rag re-emerged.\n\nDuring Phase 2 the major differences are that Molten Seeds/Elementals work differently. Elementals gain a buff which causes them to be immune to CC and do more damage, and they gain an additional instance of this buff for every other Elemental which is within a few yards of them. Therefore there are two ways to deal with these - the raid spreads out very far apart and each player deals with their own add where it spawns, or the raid stacks up and moves as one large group just before the Seeds land, then AOEs the adds down after they spawn before they reach anyone. We used the latter method for 25-man, the former method is more viable for 10-man. Ragnaros will cast \"World in Flames\" after every add wave, which works like the Heigan Dance. It's best for players to stand roughly inbetween where the bands of Engulfing Flames can spawn so their movement is minimized to avoid this.\n\nWe blew our one extra trap up after the first Engulfing Flames of P2 was done and covered it with Spirit Link.\n\nDPS on Ragnaros himself is most important in Phase 3. When Ragnaros casts World in Flames, he is unable to cast any other abilities or do a phase transition. Therefore, what we did was we slowed DPS around the 44% mark and waited for him to do another seed/add wave (the third). After killing the adds, we then got him as close to 40.6% (the mark where he submerges) as possible and waited for him to start casting World in Flames. When he starts this cast, you have the entire 9 seconds of him casting it to burn as much of his HP as possible, then he will start the submerging dialogue and you will have another 8 seconds of DPS before he goes under. Doing this can shave 5-6% off of his health which is damage you do not need to do in phase 3.\n\nThe second phase transition is the same as the first in regards to Sons and Lava Scions. The goal here is to kill both Scions before Ragnaros re-emerges. Any Sons of Flame which are still alive after he re-emerges will detonate regardless of where they are after 3 seconds. What we did was we would leave one Son alive while burning the Scions down, then kill the Son just as he re-emerged. Ideally both Scions will be dead as he re-emerges.\n\nPhase 3 works the same as normal aside from World in Flames. The ideal goal in this phase is to have as few meteors as possible, thus P3 being a DPS race. Our goal was 1 meteor. We burned the boss and used Bloodlust after the first World in Flames cast ended. When the meteor spawned, Death Knights knocked it back away from the raid so that it could be ignored as much as possible during the phase. When Ragnaros reaches 10% health, he cannot cast any other abilities (including summoning more meteors) and all damage done to him will reduce the amount of health he starts with in phase 4, so he should be burned until submerging.\n\nThere is a ~15 second window between P3 and P4 where Concentration Potions or other abilities that would be otherwise dangerous can be used.\n\nNote that as P4 starts, you CANNOT approach the boss until his legs appear coming up from the ground, if you run towards him before this you will fall in the lava and die.\n\nPhase 4: When the Druid NPCs spawn, they freeze any meteors on the platform. These should be knocked back to the edge. Ragnaros will then emerge from the lava starting at 50% health minus whatever you were able to knock off below 10% of his HP before he submerged. The raid should assign 3 main positions where groups of 7 people will stack in a triangle around Breadth of Frost to avoid Molten Geysers forming. Any player who gets Fixate from a Meteor at this point will need to kite it around the outside of the raid for as long as possible before knocking it away and returning to the raid stack to drop their Superheated stacks. Players returning must move straight in towards their group and not try to come in sideways between two groups as this can trigger a Geyser and wipe the raid. When the second Breadth spawns, the raid moves to it, and the player with Fixate will bring the meteor into the first Breadth where it will become frozen and can be killed. It is imperative that this Meteor is killed, Meteors that become frozen take 50% more damage and should die within a few GCDs.\n\nRagnaros himself will channel \"Empower Sulfuras\" causing any melee attacks he does to do 500K damage to the entire raid. A warrior tank is rather ideal here. When the Entrapping Roots spawn, the tank must wait for Ragnaros to start channeling his Empower cast, then must move to the other side of the roots so the boss walks into them and is stunned before being able to melee with this buff. Stunning him / kiting him causes the Empower buff to fall off. Heroic Leap, life grip, Stampeding Roar / a swiftness potion are best used here so the tank can accomplish this. The remainder of the phase is repeating this while Dreadflame extinguishers (classes that can do a lot of damage on the move such as Hunters, or classes with high movement speed such as feral druids/shamans) work to keep paths clear around Breadth and roots spawns. The \"enrage\" is running out of room on the platform due to Dreadflame spreading.\n\nThe major factors for downing this boss are\n\n- High DPS from everyone in P3/P4\n- Minimize damage taken from Engulfing Flames\n- Good positioning\n- Good RNG with P4 spawns", "date": "2011-10-06T08:45:44-05:00", "rating": 15, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-10-06T08:53:54-05:00", 1, "citrique"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 32, "id": 1555288, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Iroared", "body": "To reiterate some things, specifically for 10-man version (heroic).\n\nPhase 1 - the only noticeable difference is the debuff from detonating a trap; we usually had 2 traps left over. One was usually detonated somewhere in phase 2, and the other before phase 4.\nTransition - sons of flame spawn very differently from normal. They spawn very randomly, e.g. you can get a hammer on the left and 5 elementals next to it, or sometimes only one elemental would spawn near the hammer. The goal is to be quick on distributing people between the sides. The sons themselves only have slightly higher health than in normal mode - around 200k.\n\nPhase 2 - engulfing flames are replaced by world in flames, which casts a shorter version of engulfing flames several times in a row. As soon as the animation for the new flames starts, you can move to the space that was previously covered in flames. Its very easy to move out of, even if you didn't stand at the edge. The ticks don't one-shot you, but they hurt healer's mana, which is very important here.\nAdds from seeds have increased damage when they are close together. We ended up dealing with it just by spreading out slightly once they come out - we could still AoE them and they don't hurt that much.\nTransition - same as the previous one, with added Lava Scions, which tanks have to remember to pick up, hit a couple times, and ignore until the sons are dealt with. Leave one son with low health until the scions are dead or until ragnaros re-emerges, at which point the son has to be quickly killed or it will explode. You really don't want scions alive when the next phase starts, as DPS is very important here.\n\nPhase 3 - the only difference from normal is world in flames, same as phase 2. DPS here is really important, this is the place to use bloodlust/heroism (we actually had our hunter spec BM for this fight, since we don't have a shaman and the mage wasn't able to play for some time). The goal is to get him to 10% before the second meteor, which was really tough timing for us (the first meteor should spawn at about 20% in a successful pull). We always kept trying when the second meteor spawned, but we never got far into phase 4 this way.\n\nPhase 4 - the most important part is getting the meteor(s) out of the way. This is when most defensive cooldowns will be used. The raid has to be precise at positioning within breadths (note: in 4.3 the geysers were removed and you can just stack together). We didn't bother with making people run out to kite meteors, usually knocking it back on cooldown was enough to keep it away until the second breadth spawns.\nOnce the meteor is down, it should stabilize as you don't have to be in a hurry anymore and people can stay around in the old breadth until the way is clear. The main challenge at this point (other than not being overrun by dreadflames) is for tanks to quickly react to roots spawns. The roots will often spawn right next to ragnaros, and he has to be moved away until Empowered Sulfuras (which happens in 8 seconds, unless he stops to cast more dreadflames). If this is not done, the roots will be wasted and you will have to taunt-kite the boss for 10 seconds, which means a lot of wasted tank cooldowns for surviving superheated and additional stress. A good strategy is for the tank not currently on the boss to move out a few seconds before the roots spawn, ready to taunt the boss if he needs to be moved quickly. Once roots spawned and the boss is away from them, the other tank runs behind the roots and gets ready to taunt. The first tank has to remember to stop attacking.\nDreadflames in 10-man is only handled by one person with cloudburst, in our case it was a balance druid who spent most of phase 4 in cat form for faster movement.\nThis phase is very prone to randomness, e.g. first dreadflames spawning near cloudburst can allow the extinguisher to get rid of them completely, whereas if they spawn far away they can quickly get out of control. If breadths spawn in the middle of dreadflames, you're out of luck, you will have to wait for the next one and hope its close by. On our first kill we had very lucky spawns, with 3 breadths spawning in almost the same place.", "date": "2011-10-27T16:19:01-05:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-12-24T03:20:27-06:00", 2, "Iroared"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 37, "id": 1577563, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Namnalia", "body": "Some tips we wiped 97 times for before finally getting our kill yesterday on the heroic ragnaros(10m):\n\nGeneral: Don't waste your time with bad setups. We benched our resto shaman and dps warrior from the very beginning and had our feral dd respec to balance. It may be possible to beat the encounter with unusual setups, but given the time needed to learn it even with a nearly optimal setup (we had Pala/Warrior Tank, Pala/Druid Heal, 2 Moonkins, 1 Demo Warlock, 1 Arcane Mage, Hunter and Rogue), I would never even try it if I had any choice.\n\nPhase 1: If your DPS is decent (and it has to be, otherwise you won't manage P3) slow down on dpsing so that you can detonate a trap at  71/72 percent. This way you'll only have one trap in P1,5/P2 which just eases stuff. \n\nPhase 2: We optimized our complete setup for this phase, taking 2 Owlkins with us and only one melee. Our tactic was going together from one side to the other, spawning all of the adds in one point. Our warlock (me) and our arcane mage, however, started on the opposing side. This way, we could actually help bombing (you always have aggro of the add you spawned yourself) while the melee finished one of our adds, leaving one harmless add for the cleanup. This tactic changed P2 from nearly unmanageable to easy.\n\nBefore P2.5 starts, bring the boss to 42%, wait for World in Flames, then dps him down as hard as you can without using crucial CDs (you'll need them in P3). This way, you can start P3 with 37% instead of 39%.\n\nPhase 2.5: Have one designated DD prepare an add for a later kill, we had a person to do this on both sides and they communicated who would prepare an add according to the hammer position and number of adds. This way, you can optimize the dps on the adds. With good spawn points, we occasionally started P3 without Scions.\n\nPhase 3: we had our hunter and healers take care of the meteors as much as possible to free up the dps, but I guess the main key to success is a good Phase 2.5 and the World-in-Flames-Trick at the end of P2.\n\nPhase 4: Rule number one is definitely: Don't panic. The phase is rather easy now that you don't have to deal with 3+ meteors. We had one range DD (an owlkin) on meteor duty, meaning that he would kick it away again and again and announce the moment we kite it into our zone (usually parallely to the first roots). Afterwards, it's basically tank and spank with a twist, just be communicative about dreadflame spawnpoints. Right before roots spawned, our offtank left the camp to taunt the boss away from roots spawning right under him (happens more often than you would think, especially on good tries). We had some tries where the dreadflames seemed rather unmanagable (spawning as far apart of each other as possible everytime), but in most of the cases, if your fire extinguisher knows what he's doing, he'll manage it. Took us roughly 25-30 tries in P4 to actually get a kill, probably less than 10% of what guilds had to invest before the nerf :-)\n\nPro tip:\nWhen we reached P4 rather consistently, we allowed trash talking during P1 and P2 (not during Submission Phases) to overcome the extreme boredom of the first 8 minutes of the fight until you finally reach the \"hot\" phase. This made the whole progression a lot funnier without causing any unneccessary wipes.", "date": "2011-11-21T09:49:52-06:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-11-21T09:53:11-06:00", 3, "Namnalia"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 39, "id": 1605711, "nreplies": 1, "sticky": 0, "user": "916115", "body": "The Firelord and his brethren once held sway over the entire world. As a servant of the Old Gods, he fought against the Titans for domination over the planet. The victorious Titans banished him and his brethren to the Elemental Plane \u2014 there to remain imprisoned until the end of time. It was then and there that the brothers turned on each other. For five millennia a battle was fought at the core of this world. It was during the Elemental Sundering that Ragnaros attacked Thunderaan, Prince of Air. Thunderaan was utterly defeated and the Firelord feasted upon his essence, but was unable to consume him entirely. Ragnaros divided what remained between his servants, Baron Geddon and Garr.\r\n\r\nIn the center of a vast lake of fire in the Elemental Plane stands Sulfuron Keep, the home of Ragnaros. Until comparatively recently, he ruled his underground land with a molten iron fist.\r\n\r\nAround three hundred years ago the ambitious and ruthless Dark Iron clan initiated a war against their dwarven brethren, the Bronzebeard clan and Wildhammer clan, thinking that they were about to unite against the Dark Irons. During this War of the Three Hammers, the Dark Iron dwarf leader named Thaurissan lay siege to the Bronzebeard's capital city of Ironforge, while his wife Modgud attacked the Wildhammer capital of Grim Batol. Mudgod was succesful in her assault upon the Wildhammer dwarves, but Thaurissan proved less succesful. The Bronzebeard dwarves repelled his attack and quickly dispatched aid to the Wildhammer dwarves. In a short time, the Dark Irons' fortunes took a turn for the worse, and they were pushed back to the city of Thaurissan, the Dark Iron dwarven home. Thaurissan, seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would turn the tide of the war back to his favor, called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To Thaurissan's surprise, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.\r\n\r\nNow, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. The volcano, known as Blackrock Mountain, was bordered by what is now known as the Searing Gorge, to the north, and the Burning Steppes, to the south. Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving Dark Iron clan brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. Many Dark Iron dwarves remain within the lower areas of the mountain, especially Blackrock Depths, toiling away at the behest of Ragnaros and the Firelord's lieutenants. They worship Ragnaros, considering him not only a Elemental Lord but also an Old God, although he is only affiliated with the Old Gods. The Bronzebeards and Wildhammers, however, remain free.\r\n\r\nWitnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, the Bronzebeards' King Madoran and Wildhammers' King Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros. Now he lies at the bottom of that volcano on Azeroth, striving to find a way home, as well as to gather his strength once again so he can burn away Azeroth and take it for his own. Meanwhile, in Sulfuron Keep and elsewhere across the Firelands, his elemental princes battle constantly for dominance. He and his dwarven minions took control of the Blackrock mountain's volcanic depths and made war on the orcs in the Upper Blackrock Spire, which served as the seat of power for Nefarian the black dragon. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain.", "date": "2012-01-02T08:21:05-06:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting information, do you have a source?", "creationdate": "2016-01-21T23:31:21-06:00", "id": 926123, "rating": 0, "commentid": 1605711, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 256, "username": "Eido", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

As I had earlier wiped during attempts at soloing Ragnaros because of fall damage, I planned to equip some healing gear so I could easily heal back to full when I'd take fall damage next time. The libram is probably the only item that's equipped only for extra damage. This gear-setup gave me a whopping 460 Fire Resistance (giving me the resistance rating \"Excellent\", never seen that before) when combined with Fire Resistance Aura. Using a [i]Bind on Account[/i]-weapon as [url=http://www.wowhead.com/user=ludafrank]ludafrank[/url] suggested (thanks man!)

This increased the \"safe\" distance at which Ragnaros could knock me back with. \r\n\r\nHealing turned out to be a lot easier than I had expected. [i]Divine Plea[/i] supplied me with all the mana I needed, and [i]Judgement of Light[/i] kept me at full HP almost the entire fight.

Interestingly, I died several times on trash but never on a boss.  I have 264 gear and used a disc pvp spec (for the extra dps from spell reflection).  Archangel is a must for mana regeneration.\r\n\r\nA few notes in no particular order.\r\n\r\n-- Ragnaros's adds are far more challenging than he is, and because of Rag's 1.1 million hit points you'll need to go through several waves of adds.  The adds' combined dps is easily enough to take out a disc priest if you're not careful.  I used power infusion + holy nova spam for a while, but when I dropped to 50% health, I'd fear then focus my dps on the remaining adds near me.  They only have 15k health each and have usually dropped about half from the holy nova spam, so they die fairly quickly.  Hint: fight on the NE side of Ragnaros so you get tossed back into lava, not onto land.\r\n\r\n-- The big fire elemental trash (firelords?  I don't recall their name) are quite a pain.  The have a 15 second silences which is an absolute killer. Not to mention their adds begin splitting.  The adds have a large pile of health each, so it takes a while to get them down (which leaves others to split in the meantime).  I generally focused all my dps on the fire lord and got out my shadowfiend for extra dps as soon as possible, then focused on the adds.  Mostly though you can avoid these guys.\r\n\r\n-- I thought Garr would be more difficult than he was.  I pulled by DOT'ing up a few adds but mostly did my damage through holy nova spam.  Power Word: Shield worked surprisingly well in spite of Garr's dispel magic, as they'd beat through it fairly quickly anyway.\r\n\r\n-- Geddon was a joke.  I fought him in the tunnel to avoid being tossed very high in the air.\r\n\r\n-- Golemagg wasn't too tough, although he did hit rather hard once he was enraged.  I pulled out my shadowfiend after his enrage then cast fade so I could focus my attacks without needing as much healing.  They killed the shadowfiend rather quickly though, so in retrospect I might have been better off serving as a tank while letting the shadowfiend dps Golemagg instead.\r\n\r\n-- Sulfuron's healers hit surprisingly weakly.  I mana burned them outta mana then blew 'em away one by one.  E-Z.\r\n\r\n-- Majordomo's adds were something of a pain, as I had him and eight adds on me at once.  That means their dps drops during the fight though, so don't be afraid to burn your cooldowns earlier on.  (It's an 8-10 minute fight anyway).  I mana burned the healers out of mana (doesn't take long) then pulled out my shadowfiend and focus'ed one down.  From there on it was just a matter of killing the healers one by one, then the other adds.  All in all, not difficult.  Just time-consuming and requiring a bit of concentration.\r\n\r\n-- Shazzrah has a -75% healing curse on you during the fight.  Rather annoying, but you can heal through it anyway (if not very efficiently).  I spent a lot of time ducking out of his flamestorm, but in restrospect I might have been served just sitting through it so I could nuke him down faster.\r\n\r\nOverall, a very fun experience.  I was surprised I was able to do it.  Quite fun, and an enjoyable challenge for the bored discipline priest.", "date": "2010-10-25T11:34:00-05:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

They're pretty easy fights and struggle just to beat through improved Recuperate. I use Evasion on the ones with large groups of trash, by the time my 20sec evade runs out they've all died to FoK spam and the boss follows shortly. There isn't much else to say, they're too easy to give strategy. I will say that I learned to point Ragnaros a certain direction so that I land on the ground after punts... that's about it. I could also suggest using Cloak on Baron's bomb debuff to avoid being sky tossed, but it'll only work 1 time and he'll get off 3-4 bombs if you're solo. On Gar and the others with adds just spam FoK with Evasion.\r\n\r\nI also 2man BWL weekly with a guildmember and am starting up SSC/Eye raids too. We all want our fancy T5 and weapons for next patch.

Tried the following all with some success (all in battle stances):\r\n\r\n1.  Nightelf Pure Fury Warrior (with a couple points in Arms and Protection) @ 83, Titan's Grip, and enhanced Bloodthirst / Regeneration bonuses (my normal setup).  No fire resist though.  Figured out how to at least land on the high cliff but can't figure out for the life of me if I can use charge at all while being thrown; it seems to be not at all despite everyone seemingly to say the contrary.  Had no to minor problems with the other bosses but was able to defeat them all except Ragnaros so far.\r\n2.  Respeced into Arms/Fury with that enhanced charge to hit it in the air - that helped a lot!  Seems like I take more damage though with Arms spec.\r\n3.  Arms/Fury boosted from 0 FR up to ~108 Fire Resist\r\n4.  Tried all three of above combinations with 2H+Shield, 2H alone or 1H+Shield...  Seems like the order of best damage I could do was 1H+Shield Fury or Arms, 2H+Shield Fury, and then just plain old 2H with the Arms tree active.  \r\n5.  Tried again with +FR and one of those Darkmoon Cards giving a small heal boost when hitting in melee.  It helped slightly but of course no where near enough.\r\n---(edit)\r\n6.  Purchased a Mending scroll for my weapon.  It helped enough to notice some fight longevity but not enough to counteract his damage.\r\n7.  Likewise tried a Windwalker scroll - that too gave some avoiding damage but not quite enough.\r\n8.  Put an enchantment on every piece of armor I had... helped a little.\r\n9.  Tried a few Golem potions.  Again, nice damage output but not enough.\r\n\r\nGreatest success so far is pretty much the order listed, though the amounts don't vary by too much... I can get him down to the 700's (finally got into 670s on my last try) but nothing close enough to beat him down yet.  Using pot and regeneration but that's pretty much it for healing regardless of setup.  ilevel is about 310.\r\n\r\nJust not sure if I'm geared up enough just yet.  The few warriors posting so far haven't said their levels except for I think, the one 80... I'd imagine I'd be able to kill him at 85 though I hope.  Not saying he's *supposed* to be easy after all but I just wonder if there's something I'm doing \"wrong\".\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFrom the later attempts with focusing on pure defense (1H, Shield, FR), damage (2H, Golem Pot, no FR), or healing (1 or 2H, FR, Mending) I've gotten him consistently down into the 600s.  With mending, I finally hit the upper 400s so getting there ;).  \r\n\r\nAfter every possible combo I can think of, I think I'll simply have to return and try this again at 84 or 85.  Since those two levels continue to offer huge health boosts and recoveries (regeneration), I would think it's doable at 85.", "date": "2011-09-16T04:55:06-05:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-09-17T02:56:51-05:00", 1, "TheRealLink"]}

As a servant of the Old Gods, he fought against the Titans for domination over the planet. The victorious Titans banished him and his brethren to the Elemental Plane \u2014 there to remain imprisoned until the end of time. It was then and there that the brothers turned on each other. For five millennia a battle was fought at the core of this world. It was during the Elemental Sundering that Ragnaros attacked Thunderaan, Prince of Air. Thunderaan was utterly defeated and the Firelord feasted upon his essence, but was unable to consume him entirely. Ragnaros divided what remained between his servants, Baron Geddon and Garr.\r\n\r\nIn the center of a vast lake of fire in the Elemental Plane stands Sulfuron Keep, the home of Ragnaros. Until comparatively recently, he ruled his underground land with a molten iron fist.\r\n\r\nAround three hundred years ago the ambitious and ruthless Dark Iron clan initiated a war against their dwarven brethren, the Bronzebeard clan and Wildhammer clan, thinking that they were about to unite against the Dark Irons. During this War of the Three Hammers, the Dark Iron dwarf leader named Thaurissan lay siege to the Bronzebeard's capital city of Ironforge, while his wife Modgud attacked the Wildhammer capital of Grim Batol. Mudgod was succesful in her assault upon the Wildhammer dwarves, but Thaurissan proved less succesful. The Bronzebeard dwarves repelled his attack and quickly dispatched aid to the Wildhammer dwarves. In a short time, the Dark Irons' fortunes took a turn for the worse, and they were pushed back to the city of Thaurissan, the Dark Iron dwarven home. Thaurissan, seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would turn the tide of the war back to his favor, called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To Thaurissan's surprise, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.\r\n\r\nNow, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. The volcano, known as Blackrock Mountain, was bordered by what is now known as the Searing Gorge, to the north, and the Burning Steppes, to the south. Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving Dark Iron clan brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. Many Dark Iron dwarves remain within the lower areas of the mountain, especially Blackrock Depths, toiling away at the behest of Ragnaros and the Firelord's lieutenants. They worship Ragnaros, considering him not only a Elemental Lord but also an Old God, although he is only affiliated with the Old Gods. The Bronzebeards and Wildhammers, however, remain free.\r\n\r\nWitnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, the Bronzebeards' King Madoran and Wildhammers' King Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros. Now he lies at the bottom of that volcano on Azeroth, striving to find a way home, as well as to gather his strength once again so he can burn away Azeroth and take it for his own. Meanwhile, in Sulfuron Keep and elsewhere across the Firelands, his elemental princes battle constantly for dominance. He and his dwarven minions took control of the Blackrock mountain's volcanic depths and made war on the orcs in the Upper Blackrock Spire, which served as the seat of power for Nefarian the black dragon. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain.", "date": "2012-01-02T08:20:15-06:00", "rating": 25, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
