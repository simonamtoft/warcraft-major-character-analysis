{"commentv2": 1, "number": 2, "id": 7328, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "7458", "body": "There have been loads of speculations about Onyxia. After killing her for almost two years now i have come to conclude a few things.\n\nPhase 1 is very very very easy especially now with KTM Threat meater all people have to do is stay 10k threat (this is because every time she knockbacks the tank, the tank looses 10k threat) under the tank till 75% and then nuke her down to fall into phase 2.\n\nA lot of people whine about her doing deep breadths (phase 2) because everyone is not spread out etc. This is just a myth. The only reason people should spread out is not to take aoe damage from the firebolt. I have two theroies why she does deep breadths. My first theory is that if you do a substantial ammount of dps on her in phase 2 meaning everyone is nuking the hell out of her (including rogues and warriors) she will not deep breadth. Another theory is that most people in the raid are not on her threat list since a lot of raid leaders want people to spread out and do nothing because most of the time she is not in range. Though if people use thier bows and run around a little bit just to hit once and be on that threatlist after she moves (every time onyxia moves in phase two aggro is reset) she will not but that would defy my first theory.\n\nThird phase is the hardest but can be the most easiest this all depends on how fast and good your main tank is. If he does manage to pull onyxia stright away and gain fast ammount of threat from here on onyxia can be nuked down. I also have a speculation about her in the 3rd phase. Most of the time she fears a lot sometimes no. I have come to conclude that if there is a high ammount of dps on her in the second phase she will fear less than if there was no dps at all. So that is why its all up to the main tank. More threat = More Nuke = Less Fears = Killing her very fast.

A few notes:\r\n\r\n- I wore the fire resist gear you can get from badges and the phoenix-fire band from the obsolete TK attunement chain.  With that and the fire resist aura, I was running at 307 FR.  According to a WWS analysis, this prevented roughly 68% of the incoming fire damage, which is far more important, since the physical damage is fairly trivial.\r\n\r\n- I also used the trinket from the Ashtongue Deathsworn.  The majority of my damage was going to be from judging Seal of Vengeance, so a 50% chance at a DoT that I'd be shooting for every ten seconds was a huge boon.  Ultimately, it accounted for ~10% of my damage.\r\n\r\n- For my second trinket, I used the Commendation of Kael'thas.  The idea was that during phase 2 the proc might be helpful if the whelps got me too low, but that ended up being a non-issue.\r\n\r\nMy general strategy was to tank her in the back of the room where she'd typically be tanked anyway.  I used Seal of Vengeance and judged Wisdom on cooldown.  For healing, I used Holy Shock whenever it was up--most of the melee damage was insignificant, and the breath attack only hit for ~1.6k, so it was plenty to keep me up.  I did not bother with Consecrate.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 I was concerned about, but it turns out you can indeed still melee her from the ground if you're directly beneath her.  I changed my aura to Retribution Aura to help deal with the whelps.  For the initial spawn, I ignored Onyxia and concentrated on getting them down.  Once that was done, I simply followed her around the room, using the same attack pattern.  I didn't bother avoiding deep breaths--again, they were mitigated to the point of irrelevance, doing maybe 3-4k damage apiece.  I largely ignored further whelp spawns and just started using consecrate when I had a lot on me.\r\n\r\nBecause I was occasionally forced to use consecrate, this was the only phase that gave me mana trouble.  Whenever I'd get below 30% or so, I'd switch to Seal of Wisdom and just melee it all back to full.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 was pretty much identical to phase 1 (including switching back to fire resist aura).  The fear lasted such a short time that it was more of a minor inconvenience to have to run back to my initial place (I still didn't want to get punted into whelps).  Also, it'd disable auto-attack, which was annoying.  Again, since the eruptions were fire damage, they were immaterial.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it ended up taking me an hour and 45 minutes to down her with my elite holy paladin dps.  In all honesty, it wasn't very difficult from a technique standpoint, just incredibly tedious.", "date": "2008-10-30T17:10:36-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Her Flame Breath (Phases 1 & 3) hit for up to 4000 and during the airphase her Fireballs hit for about 1800 fire damage.\n\nDue to the high amount of fire-based attacks I used Fire Resistance Totem at all times and it cut the fire damage taken roughly in half.\n\nThe fight took about 18 minutes, but I probably could have done it alot faster (I had some mana management issues due to the fact that I forgot to rebuff Water Shield for the majority of the fight.)

Your mileage may vary)\n\nFirst, make sure that both of your weapons have Windfury, since: a) Onyxia is immune to Flametongue and Lava Lash, and b) you want it proccing as often as possible to keep Maelstrom Weapon ready in order to heal yourself.\n\nPhase 1: Tank her at the back of the room, just like the old days. FR totem is basically a must.  Pretty much the only ability I used at this point was Stormstrike to conserve mana, with the occasional Earthshock in hopes of proccing [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=29180]Elemental Devastation[/url].  I was taking about 900-1100 damage a hit, but was easily able to keep myself up with Greater Healing Wave.  Make sure that you are keeping your Water Shield up, and don't waste Maelstrom Weapon procs on anything but healing yourself.\n\nPhase 2: Switch to Lightning Shield and run into the middle to gather the whelps.  Drop an Earth Elemental Totem to get a few seconds of breathing room, and then summon your wolves.  The healing from the wolves should easily overcome the damage from the whelps.  Clean up survivors with melee, and then put back your regular totems/Water Shield.\nAs she flies around, Onyxia will drag you away from your FR totem, keep it up and just DPS when you can.  The smaller whelp groups are easily dispatched with melee.\n\nPhase 3: Pull her back to the wall and drop Tremor totem.  Repeat phase 1 strat, making sure to keep refreshing the totem.  Earn easy gold.  Note! Don't make my mistake and try and tank her where she lands, lest her wing buffet toss you over the wall, into the eggs, which is of course 50 DKP minus.

If your health is an issue here then give up now - Phase 2 will toast you.\r\n\r\nSecond phase - As soon as she takes off shift out and heal up to max - then shift back into bear and swipe whelps till they stop coming\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not it is possible to stand under ONY and hit her while she's flying, so you don't need a ranged attack.  Just move under her until your mangle un-greys out and hit her for all you are worth - you are going to need to follow her around a lot.

Fireballs aren't a huge deal, Deep breath knocks off about 1/4 of my max health. It's a good idea to choose a whelp-free time to barkskin-shift out and heal up - try to keep your health above 10,000 (preferably higher) at all times because you can get stuck with a nasty situation of low health, many whelps and a deep breath all at once. If you get stuck here use your frenzied regen (save it for this sort of occasion). Keep beating her down till she lands - this is by FAR the most difficult phase, once you get her on the ground again you should be home free.\r\n\r\nThird Phase - tougher than phase 1, you might be low on health at this stage - If so, pop your berzerk, pop barksin and shift out and heal up.

If your AP isn't up to snuff then you will need to FoL yourself at almost every opportunity (meaning whenever Art of War is up). You need to make sure your health stays above 50% or so because you will need to blow Divine Plea whenever the cooldown is up. (I tried it once using Judgement of Wisdom, but found I actually ended up with more mana--and more success--using Judgement of Light to help keep myself alive.) The fight took about 17 minutes, meaning (at least if your gear is bad like mine) that you will have enough time to bubble more than once should it prove necessary. Fire Resistance Aura was a must; don't even worry about the slight loss of DPS inherent in not using Retribution Aura.\r\n\r\nThe most troublesome aspect of the fight, from a ret paladin's point of view, is keeping within melee range during phase 2.

The window will close and it will act like a disconnect, so you'll remain in the party. Log on with your main and join the raid. Your friend is free to leave while you and your level one bank alt solo Ony.\r\n[b]Phase 1:[/b] Simple as anything. Use the same strategy you learned at 18 when you soloed your first group quest: tank in bear, shift to caster as needed to hot up. Maul and Mangle as much as possible and try to keep a stack of 5 lacerates on at all times. any time you get below 70%, Barkskin and HoT quickly so you don't lose lacerate. You may have to give up your stack to Healing Touch on occasion. Rinse and repeat until...\r\n[b]Phase 2:[/b] Not hard, just annoying. This 25% of her health will probably take ten minutes. You'll probably be feral charging a lot just to find her hitbox from the ground. Run from the deep breaths and Swipe when you get whelps. It'll be impossible to reliably Lacerate often enough, so just Maul and Mangle whenever you find her. Like I said, it'll be much longer than the other two phases, despite the comparatively short amount of health to get through. Alternatively, if you're a NElf and keep a half-decent casting set, you can Shadowmeld to switch gear then use balance spells to worry less about her position. I haven't tried this, being a Tauren, but it seems like it could probably cut 4 or more minutes off the fight.\r\n[b]Phase 3:[/b] Much less of a pain than P2. Same everything as P1, just be careful where you position her so that you don't get feared into the whelps. If you survived everything before this, you shouldn't die here.\r\nThe fight usually clocks in between 20 and 25 minutes for me in Naxx10 gear. Your mileage will vary of course. Tthe 50 gold and bag along with selling whatever other stuff you get (I've gotten an Orb of Deception) make it fairly worth it as a biweekly quest.

The fight will last a VERY long time, you should keep a spare weapon with you incase your initial one breaks. (I had no problems with this.)\r\n\r\n2. Bless yourself with wisdom (Incase you have mana issues), put up FR aura for a safer encounter, or ret aura for a quicker but less safe encounter, and Seal of Light (wisdom if you do not have much mana, and are unable to sustain maximum damage).\r\n\r\n3. Keep sacred shield up at all times, as Onyxia sustains a very low damage output, sacred shield should be able to soak up 90% of most damage. Whenever you take a bit of damage, you should let Seal of Light or Judgement of Light Heal yourself back up, as you will not be taking much damage.\r\n\r\n4. Onyxia will cast a fire breath, this will hit you for average ~ 1600 damage, although you may sometimes completely resist it (courtesy of FR aura).\r\n\r\n5. You should fight against a wall to avoid the annoying knockback, and you should use all damage dealing attacks frequently whenever off cooldown.\r\n\r\n6. When the adds come, simply walk to the center of the room, pop your ret aura, and consecrate. This is probably the hardest bit of the encounter as you will take a fair bit of damage, just spam flash of light on yourself and keep sacred shield up (Only needed for those around level 70, level 80 folk will find it a lot easier.)\r\n\r\n7.

Argent Confessor Paletress will evidently take players on a wild ride against past bosses from raids, instances, and even elites outside of dungeons.\n\nHer infamous Deep Breath is seeing a significant rework, and as such, will doubtless lead to vast amounts of theorywork concerning its mechanics. Not to worry, I have dataminehaxxed the information from the server, and have worked out precisely the way in which Deep Breath will work.\n\nOnyxia's deep breaths are actually going to be Blizzard's first example of achievements having an effect on actual gameplay other than mounts.\n\nFirst off, your 5-man group must have a cumulative total between 7000 and 15000 achievement points, which will assure that she does her deep breath no more than seven(!) times. Any less, and your intrepid group of would-be champions may face as many as nine breaths. If your cumulative total is above 20000, then she will deep breath no more than five. However, it doesn't stop there!\n\nSpecial attention is paid to raid achievements. Those that have downed every boss in WotLK before 3.2 (on normal modes) will see a reduction of the number of deep breaths by two. Those that have downed all the hardmodes of bosses (not including Yogg+0 and Algalon) will see a reduction of 3.  And if your group consists of players that have managed to do every single raid achievement (not including realm firsts, but including Algalon on both difficulties), you'll only be hit by one deep breath.\n\nHowever, those that have at least one player with a realm first kill on Algalon will see 20 deep breaths.  Those that consist of a group of all players with realm first achievements on Algalon.. she will ONLY use deep breath.\n\nHave fun, and good luck!  Also, when all players have both a http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40110 and http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23555 in their inventories (it is possible to bug this encounter and do this if only one person has the haunted memento by throwing it very quickly in the last 1% to the tank, but this means the tank cannot already have it), she has a 3% chance to drop [b][Head of Kael'Thas] -This fantabulous head is an extremely fast flying mount.

Spotting Ony during DB can be tricky, so you Have to keep on your toes, or desiginate a \"spotter\" and understand your (spotters) Lingo. \r\n\r\nWhen Mele is on the Guards, If they start a Nova (very slow casting) Just run out of range. you have to kill them before Flame Blade. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, We had a Very hard time hitting Ony from the ground with Mele. you have to be Right under her, and she is always moving.

Mele should chase her from behind and Hit her Hard while she walks. her Tail is InOpperable during that walk, and it will set you up to be right near the first wave of whelps.

It's difficult for melee dps to stay on Onyxia the entire fight due to her constant movement and tiny hit box in phase 2.  What you should do is have ranged stay on Onyxia the entirety of phase 2 (to speed up how fast the phase goes by) and have melee focus on all adds, including the guardians.\r\n\r\nThe guardians have Ignite Weapon (causes significant fire damage to tank every melee swing, and causes that damage to all targets within 5 yards of tank), Cleave, and Blast Wave, which is a fire aoe with a 5 second cast time.  Just have the melee dps stand behind the adds at max range and they shouldn't be hit by Ignite Weapon or Cleave.  Then if Blast Wave looks like it is going to go off, the melee dps should simply run from the guardian until the cast finishes, then run back in and finish the add.", "date": "2009-09-23T11:51:51-05:00", "rating": 14, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 246, "id": 849516, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Ninja1", "body": "Phase 1: same o ' same o '\r\n\r\n**Phase 1 is identical to the original fight. It lasts from 100% health to 65%, and Onyxia utilizing basic dragon abilities - Flame Breath (heavy hit in frontal cone), Cleave (hitting up to 10 targets), Tail Sweep (with a large knockback), and Wing Buffet (frontal cone knockback).\r\n\r\n*Tank Onyxia with your back towards a wall, to avoid knockback from Wing Buffet.\r\n\r\n*DPS and Healers should be position at Onyxia's sides to avoid both Tail Sweep and the frontal baddies. The tank might need some heavy heals, as the spells hit rather hard, and some cannot be resisted/mitigated. Other than that, you should be fine here.\r\n\r\n**Phase 2: There is Something new here\r\nThis is probably the hardest and the most annoying part of the fight. There are two things to watch out for - adds and Onyxia's new spells. Note to melee DPS - you can still attack Onyxia even while she is in the air, as long as you stand underneath here and follow here when she moves, but remember also to avoid the Breeath if u are a bit outside.\r\n\r\n*There are two kinds of adds spawning during this phase - Onyxian Whelps and Onyxian Lair Guards.\r\n\r\nThe whelps will spawn in packs of 40 (20 on each side ). The first pack will spawn seconds after Onyxia lifts off in the air, and a pack will hatch every ~90 seconds after that while in this phase. While it is good to have a tank on them, try to AoE them down as soon as possible, as you want to mitigate overall damage and keep your mobility - you'll need both.\r\n\r\n*Make the offtank the one who Gather his own side of trash and try to move to the other side where the main tank gather his own , when all gathered, Start AOE. This will make it easier on the raid.\r\n\r\nThe Lair Guards are new NPCs added in the 3.2.2 version of Onyxia. The guards will spawn more frequently than the whelps (approximately every 30 seconds), and will spawn in pairs (possible a pair from each side). They don't have too much health, but have really high melee damage output through abilities like Cleave, Fire Nova, Flame Lash (which reduces fire resistance), and Ignite Weapon (17.5k/25k extra fire damage to targets in melee range).\r\n\r\n*It is good to have a tank on them and 1 RANGE DPS to help take them down very fast, while other have their own duty of the fight, but it is better to kill them from afar. Keep your melee DPS away from them at all times.\r\n\r\n*The other thing to watch out for are Onyxia's spells. Her Fireballs are something you should just heal through - although it is advised that you spread out, as the missiles do damage in a 10 yards wide area. /range on DBM is your friend again. And, of course, there is the Deep Breath...\r\n\r\nDeep Breath is now on 100% random cast intervals - which means that DBM, or BigWigs, or whatever boss mods addon you use won't be able to warn you in advance. You will however see a raid warning/emote \"Onyxia takes a deep breath\". As soon as you see that, you need to forget about anything else you are doing, locate Onyxia, figure out which way she is facing, and get behind her quickly. Deep Breath is very unforgiving.\r\n\r\n**REMEMBER DO not Tank the Whelps or the Warden in the middle, as she make her Deep Breath all straight. Everyone in the Raid, EVERYONE should have a look where she is aiming her head before she hit the Breath.\r\n\r\nPhase 3: NUKE, Yes Nuke it.\r\n\r\n**Phase 3 starts when Onyxia's health reaches 40%. At this point she will land permanently and cast a raid-wide fear, accompanied by lava eruptions. Raid wide damage, with extras for the tank - nothing you haven't seen before.\r\n\r\nUnlike the original version of the fight, Onyxia will no longer wipe aggro between phases, which means that your tank from Phase 1 should be the first person she goes to in Phase 3. So as i said, NUKE IT..!\r\n\r\nThroughout this phase Onyxia will continue to use all of her abilities from phase 1 (Flame Breath, Cleave, Tail Sweep, Wing Buffet), alongside with Bellowing Roar (3-second fear) and Eruption (AoE during the fear). Whelps will continue to spawn as well, but they won't be nearly as many as in Phase 2, so a few of your ranged DPS should be able to handle them quickly.\r\n\r\nNote: If a player gets close to the eggs, at any point of the fight, the nearest whelps will hatch. This is why it's very important to move carefully and not get knocked back during any of the phases.\r\n\r\nVideo Fight ------ > http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZA3CQRj5o&feature=related", "date": "2009-09-23T17:02:04-05:00", "rating": 8, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

[/b][/u]\n\nHope some of you are as lucky as me to get the amazing mount to remember this great anniversary from/and or the pet! Happy Hunting/Looting, and don't ninja loot enless you wana be marked for like, cause this is something that will never be forgotten and trust me neither will your ninja mark!\n\nJust have fun with this great event, and if you dont get the mount be happy anyways, this is a great occasion! :D\n\nAfter some Searching and information from informants I have found out we will be receiving the pet in November During the actual date of the 5th anniversary! I also have heard rumors that onyxia will return to her original pre TBC State after the anniversary in november, But have also heard rumors of her actually staying this way forever, but it was stated at Blizzcon that it was only for the 5th anniversary, so my Beliefs are that she will return to her original state of Pre-TBC After the 5th anniversary.  I Believe they just started the Lvl 80 Onyxia Event 60 days prior to give everyone a fair chance at getting her mount/gear/accessories that they are questing or the item of choice they desire! Please don't take any of this personal or into a fact because all this is a belief/theory and none of these theories are for sure correct even tho blizzard may have stated something at blizzcon doesnt mean it will or will not be true! Only time will tell if ony will stay in the status she is in forever or if like its been said its only for the 5th anniversary!", "date": "2009-09-25T15:58:54-05:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-09-25T16:20:36-05:00", 1, "valioso"]}

The first few days of PuGs were all learning days, I know there are lots of players who came into WoW after TBC etc... so After 2 days of wipes/training I was a bit disappointed when even a guild 10 man, with vent and a plan still couldn't do it.\n\nThe biggest problem I saw was melee class saying, \"I have to dps whelps?\"  \"The Lair guards hit to hard, range should kill them\" \n\nPhase two is all about ranged DPS, if you only have 2-3 in your ten man that can take her life from 65% to 40% then that's what they have to do.  Learn how to avoid the worst of the Lair Guard attacks ( by say disarming them ) and how to live through what you can't avoid.  As for whelps, well you could get your mage/warlock on it, but again their dps might be better of focused on Onyixa when she is in range ( if your casters are stacked on say the whelp tank and she is out of range then sure they should AoE, but again what are your melee doing?, they can't even hit her right?)\n\nRaid leaders might want to think about the two types of DPS a bit more.  I was called in a few times this week to find out I was the only Ranged.  Oddly enough the PuG I first got credit for her was 2 Warriors, 2 Paladins, 3 Death Knights, 1 Druid, 1 Hunter and me ( Ele-Shaman).\nOnly the Druid and a Paladin healing.  \nDK AoE was as good as anything you could hope for on Whelps.\nThe Paladin Tank was good enough to move the stack closer to Onyixa, so the Hunter and I could hit her.\nKey Factor: No deaths to deep breaths.\n\nAnd a note to my fellow Shamans, Enhancement is a great spec, but Elemental pulls a little more weight in this encounter.

Just!\n\nOur setup was a Protection Paladin (MT), Protection Warrior (OT) (me), two Resto Druids, Resto Shaman, Enhancement (or Elemental) Shaman, Mage, Hunter, Retribution Paladin and a Warlock.\n\nWe all loosely knew what needed to be done during the three phase fight...\n\n[ul]\n[li]Phase 1: DPS Onyxia, staying away from her head and tail;[/li]\n[li]Phase 2: Stack on the MT then AOE Whelp spawns, nuke the Lair Guards, avoid Deep Breath, and channel intermittent ranged DPS at Onyxia;[/li]\n[li]Phase 3:  Repeat Phase 1 with the extra fun of Onyxia\u2019s Bellowing Roar (fear) and fire Eruptions from the floor.[/li]\n[/ul]\nThe first two phases went smoothly, with only the Retribution Paladin eating dirt mid-way through Phase 2 while fondling too many Whelps in a quiet corner of the cave. However, events took a turn for the worse at the beginning of Phase 3, with the introduction of an immediate fear from Onyxia. As a result, I went out of range of our healers and was floored by a Lair Guard while trying to limp back with my Shield Wall on its last few ticks.\n\nWith the Lair Guard running riot, four more of the group dropped \u2013 Hunter, Warlock, Enhancement Shaman and one of the Resto Druids. At this point, the MT thankfully managed to control the Lair Guard, and tanked it along with Onyxia at the back of the room. The Mage sucked the remaining life from the Lair Guard then set to work on Onyxia.\n\nUnfortunately, another fear caused the Resto Druid to be tail-swiped into some eggs, and she spent the remainder of Phase 3 with a pack of Whelps roosting in her battered branches. Onyxia\u2019s health slowly began to dip towards empty and following five minutes of frantic DPS, healing and a great deal of squealing (from the Druid), she was at 1%. At this point both the Resto Shaman and Druid alarmingly took a shot up the jacksee, leaving the MT and Mage to finally bring Onyxia to her scaly knees. Go Midnight!\n\nAs you can see, our Achilles heel was the transition from phase 2 to 3. The immediate fear caught us (well me) off-guard and ultimately cost us a fast and smooth final phase. Next time I\u2019ll remember to cosy-up to a healer as Onyxia approaches 40% HP and hit Berserker Rage so I don\u2019t get feared out of range!

This will help avoid the \"[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=68867]Tail Sweep[/url]\" attack from Ony and allow for more DPS.

Only thing left now is to get the party's health back up to par and basically beat her down. What you are going to do during this phase is almost exactly the same thing as Phase 1. Onyxia gains a couple new attacks that are a bit stronger during this phase but the rearrange in healing will compensate for this....... Main Tank will pull Onyxia back to the wall once more. All DPS stay to the sides of Ony. Slight change in the healing at this point though. Depending on how well your Healers managed their Mana by this point best is going to be having both healers paying attention to the main tank. To make sure he/ she does not die so close to the end. The tank is going to be taking the brute force of Ony. One of the healers should alternate to doing raids heals for anyone who gets hit by any of the random attacks Ony is doing. BUt once those people are healed immediately switch back to healing the tank to keep their life up. Repeat this until Onyxia dies. \n\nNote: For the DPS attacking Ony...If you notice your life being drastically reduced, most likely you are too close to Ony's face and getting the frontal cone blasts of her attacks on the tank. Back up a little away from her face while also staying away from her tail the best you can.\n\nNote: If a player is hit by the tail sweep and knocked into the whelp eggs the  OFF TANK should pull back and grab the whelp and 2 DPS should help bring those whelps down with AoE and melee. Once they are down go back to attacking Ony. If Ony is under 100k health don't worry about the welps everyone can jump on them after shes dead.\n\nNote: If by chance you died during the Onyxia fight, DO NOT RELEASE. If you have someone in your group that can battle rez have them do so periodically throughout the battle to keep people in the battle because once they are alive the healers can pick up on them again and get them back up to speed. But, if Onyxia is close to death do not release until after her death or you will not have a chance at the loot.\n\nWell I hope this helps out with the new raid. Good luck and feel free to add to this or offer any changes that you may want to see.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 306, "id": 1032102, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "258919", "body": "Fairly straightforward fight. There's a few things you need to worry about. Definitely one-tankable if you have good heals.\r\n\r\n[b]Heals[/b]\r\n- Do whatever you can do make sure the tank, at the very least, doesn't stay feared when she roars. Not only does damage not break the fear, but it also forces the tank to leave the wall which can set her up for some nasty damage on the dpsers.\r\n- Be ready to pop an instant cooldown or AoE heals when the hatchlings come out. As a tank, I have noticed that grabbing the whelps usually takes too long to ensure that absolutely nobody takes damage.\r\n\r\n[b]Tank(s)[/b]\r\n- Tank her against the back wall. The fight is fairly straightforward for tanks in phases 1 and 3.\r\n- In Phase 2, get in the middle as soon as she goes immune so you can quickly AoE threat-enize all of the whelps. The strategy I found best was to swipe (bear druid) both sides a good amount and then do a Challenging Roar to force them all on me for a few seconds. This gave me enough time to swipe my threat up to the level I needed. A stray whelp or two won't kill your raid. But any more than that, especially on healers, could cause a good run to go to a wipe in a short amount of time.\r\n- Be on the lookout for the elite adds. With a decent group, the first elite add won't spawn until the first group of whelps are down. The second one should spawn shortly after the first dies, and it's not uncommon for the add to be alive when Phase 3 begins.\r\n\r\n[b]DPS[/b]\r\n- Dragons, by nature, tend to have large, heavy tails. But they also are usually able to breath fire. Stand beside her.\r\n- Busting out in AoE as soon as the whelps spawn is never a good idea.\r\n- If there's an add alive in Phase 3, obviously, kill it.\r\n- [i]Ranged[/i] Onyxia lands at 40% health, whether the ground is clear or there just happens to be a ton of whelps sitting around. So, if there is a whelp wave incoming and she's around 45%, lay off dps completely on the boss and kill adds. Unless you have two tanks, there is little chance that you will survive whelps and Onyxia at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] Etc.[/b]\r\n- There are fires. You need to not be in them.\r\n- When she emotes deep breath, look at her flight path and get beside her. If you are in front of her, bad things happen.\r\n- If you have a shaman in your group, a tremor totem helps immensely in phases 1 and 3, due to the fear. Put it near the boss so the tank gets the effect from it.\r\n- Fire resistance is not terribly important to this fight. I managed to easily tank it with good heals and about 45k buffed hp with 75 resistance, so the only reason you would really need extra fire resistance on your gear is if you as a tank are undergeared. I would say with decent heals, any tank with around 37k buffed hp could take this boss.\r\n- Unlike some bosses' abilities, her fear can be cancelled by normal fear-cancelling abilities (such as Berserk). Use them when you can.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, an easy fight.

The fight took 43 minutes and 43 seconds, at least half of that was the air/adds phase.\n\nFor those attempting something similar, a few tips:\n- Onyxia apparently cannot be hit by melee during flying/add phase.  We managed to bring her down eventually with Outbreak and Moonfire spam while fighting off endless waves of whelps & warders.\n- Keep your healer off to the side, near the back wall during phase 3 to avoid a fear-tailwhip combo.\n- Warders' Blast Wave is not a huge threat, but best mitigated by Anti Magic Shell or running out to conserve mana.  Same goes for Deep Breath.\n- A decently geared DK tank can heal/shield through most of the adds damage with proper cooldown usage, in order to allow healer to dps Onyxia in the air.\n\nAnd finally, prepare for a LONG fight unless you have better ranged dps.

Obviously the fight has gotten a lot easier for me by now, well by easier I would mean faster, as I've done this so many times by now and gear has been greatly upgraded.\n\nI run with my standard 7/31/3 raid spec, as surviveability is not an issue for either me or my pet, and an average gear level at currently 381.\nI buff up with King's Drums and 40 agi food, in lesser gear you could probably use a flask as well until you get comfortable with the fight. Glyph of Misdirection is offcourse mandatory.\nUsing a turtle-pet, altho I don't think specifically a turtle is needed anymore, as the last ~10 kills neither shell shield or cower has been cast. Tanking pet is mostly for the increased growl threat and thunderstomp. Fight takes somewhere inbetween 6-8 minutes for me, depending a bit on RNG with whelp spawns and multishot crits. I'm sure with some gear upgrades, I should be able to make the 5 minute achievement (More Dots!).\n\n[b]Trash[/b]:\nSimple enough, but do not pull more than one at the time, your pet probably wont be able to handle it, even with cooldowns. They have about 900k hp and leaves a 75% reduced armor and increased fire damage taken debuff on your pet.\n\n[b]Phase 1[/b]:\nMisdirect Onyxia to your pet, and place the pet with the new 'Move to command' at the wall on the opposite side of the entrace, where she always use to be tanked. Keep Mend Pet up and dps her down. This phase is extremely easy.\n\n[b]Phase 2[/b]:\nAt 65% she flies up in the air, and your pet will be unable to attack most of the time, so don't bother with sticking pet on her. Go to the middle of the room and drop a slowing + explosive trap. 2 packs of whelps (approx 10 from each side) will spawn and come directly at you. When they are starting to get inside the trap, pop deterrance and wait for them to be gathered up. Disengage out and spam multishot while running in circles around the trap. (Do not MD this pack to your pet, as it will most likely not survive all those whelps whacking it). I pop rapid fire here, for the extra focus regen. The whelps will never touch you and should die pretty easily if you kite them right. Unfortunately these do not proc Rapid Killing when killed.\n([i]It is also possible to completely avoid this add wave by simply placing your pet on stay where you tanked Onyxia in Phase 1, and just feign death as soon as the whelps are close to you, but I don't like cheesing encounters like that, so I will rather kill them.[/i])\n\nWhen the whelps are down DPS Onyxia as much as you can, until the big add spawn. These can also be reset with feigning death soon as they enter the room, but they only have about ~250k hp and do next to no dmg to your pet, so just MD and kill them as soon as they come. (Do not worry about the Ignite Weapon attack, like we did on lvl 80, it barely tickles your pet.)\n\nNew whelps will come every now and then (they might be on a timer, I am really not sure, but from all the kills I've done both the timer and the amount of spawns seems random), just MD them to your pet and leave them there, while you dps down Onyxia. You don't want a lot of small ones hitting you, as they hit for 1500-2000 a pop. Kill any new big adds that spawns. With my current gear I get 2 of those big adds before entering Phase 3, in lesser gear I remember getting 3 of them.\n\nOnyxia will throw out random fireballs on both you and your pet during this phase, but do not worry, the damage is low and is easily healed up with Chimera shot alone. You can also feign or deterrance these fireballs, but it should not be needed.\n\n[b]Phase 3:[/b]\nAt 40%, or 39% actually. Onyxia will land again and start the last phase. As soon as she is on ground, feign death and send your pet to attack her. Finish off the remaining whelps from Phase 2 by multishot/MD spamming, and then just go all out on Onyxia to finish her off.\nDoesn't matter where you tank her, pet beeing feared into whelp caves will not trigger them, just make sure you stand in a safe spot yourself. You can deterrance the fear (Bellowing Roar) when you see it cast, for a few extra seconds of dps.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Phase 1 and 3 should not be a problem for anyone to get trough, it's all about managing those whelps spawns in Phase 2, while at the same time beeing able to put out some damage on the boss itself. It might take a few tries, but once you get it right, you will have another boss to farm weekly for a sweet looking mount.

As a result, I've never been overwhelmed by adds throughout the fight. They die quite quickly.\n\nPhase 1 is very straightforward. I just tank her at the back of the cave to avoid long knockbacks, and to make her walk the longest path possible when she's going to lift off.\nAs soon as Onyxia turns to head to the point of the cave where she starts to fly, I hit dash, tiger's fury and berserk to nibble as many hit points as possible while she's still grounded.\nBy the time she's completely lifted off and is out of reach I also want to make sure she has a fresh rake and rip ticking on her.\nImmediately after that, it's time to hit thorns and welcome the huge wave of whelps in bear form. If I still have 10 or more seconds left on berserk I might decide to pop a damage reduction cooldown, shift to cat form and swipe at them for the duration before I finally go bear.\nThe whole phase 2 sees me keeping whelps under control, dispatching the draconids coming from the tunnel asap, and damaging Onyxia.\nDirect attacks cannot hit her, but AoE attacks can. To bring her hit points to 40% I arm myself with patience and just hit her with swipe (bear), thrash and faerie fire feral (bear). Since swipe (cat) is demanding in terms of energy, and the afore mentioned bear abilities are boosted my my vengeance, I find it's more efficient to just stick to bear form. The only exception is when the cooldown on berserk is refreshed. When this happens, I shift to cat, pop it along with tiger's fury and swipe for the duration.\nPhase 3 is just like phase 1.

Took me good 8 hours.\r\nWhat I did was I went demonology, used the Voidwalker to tank and health funneled it.\r\n\r\nThe hardest part is phase 2, here's how I did it: I was still using the Voidwalker and I used Demon Soul to redirect the whelps to him (to anyone who does not know all threat you generate is sent to your Voidwalker while Demon Soul is up, lasts for 15 seconds). \r\n\r\nPhase 1 lasts until 65% (sometimes it's like 65.5%, it seemed kind of random), phase 2 lasts until 40% (sometimes until 39%, again kind of random), phase 3 is the final phase.\r\nPhase 1 is very easy, in fact I got through it on my first try. Basically phase 1 is a tank and spank. As I said, Phase 2 is the hardest phase, what happens is 40 whelps come out and you have to kill them quick, very quick as I understand if you just use Hellfire there will be some sort of dps cap, so you will want to use Shadowflame every time it's off cool down. I found huge help in this item, in phase 2: [item=70142]. You will want to pop metamorphosis as soon as you have any whelps on you, use the Immolation Aura, use the Moonwell Chalice, then use the Doomguard (the moonwell chalice will increase its dps), as soon as all of the whelps are on you will want to use Demon Soul and start using Hellfire, again use Shadowflame every time it's off cool down. After the whelps die you will have to dps Onyxia down to 40% as quick as possible (it should already be at about 50-55% from your Doomguard). Do not stop dpsing until DBM tells you phase 3 started, do not stop to bandage, do not stop to heal your minion, do not stop at all! Also, in phase 2 another add will come out, have your Voidwalker pick it up, don't dps it until phase 3! The second wave of whelps absolutely cannot come out, or it is going to be a wipe, also I didn't let the second add come out (the big one), every time I had 2 of those adds come out it was a wipe.\r\nOnce Onyxia is in phase 3 it will be pretty much like phase 1, only she will gain one ability: mass fear. So you will want to keep your minion topped off at all times, so if you get feared it doesn't die. Phase 3 only took me about 4 attempts, while phase 2 took like about 40-50 attempts, so do not worry about phase 3, when you can get through phase 2, you got it. \r\nI was using 10/31/0 Demonology spec.\r\nMetamorphosis/Immolate/Felguard (prime glyphs)\r\nShadow Bolt/Soul Link/Voidwalker (major glyps)\r\nMinor glyphs don't matter.\r\n\r\nYou will want to bring draconic flasks, drums (of the forgotten kings), food buffs, volcanic potions,etc. anything to bring up your dps in phase 2.\r\nYou should be using the Voidwalker throughout the whole fight, yes I thought my dps would be higher with the Felguard, but the Voidwalker has like 180k hp once you have the glyph for it, so health funnel will heal for more. \r\nYou will definitely want to use addons such as: Omen, TargetPercent, DBM, anything else you think can help you.\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2011-11-19T08:56:55-06:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Don't panic if you take quite a bit of dmg during this opening move, you'll get it back before P2 begins. Keep mend pet and MD up and just burn her down. At 65/66 % P2 will begin.\n\n[b]P2[/b]: the absolutely most tricky part of the fight. She will turn around and start walking towards the entrance to the cave. Important that your pet is still set at passive, press follow so that it stops attacking Ony and runs to you. Get as much dps off at Ony as she walks away, DO NOT FOLLOW HER. This is where I learned a key difference from most tacts I've read before. Most guides will tell you to go into the middle of the room, where the two floor plates kind of meet. This might work fine for some but I failed again and again this way, mainly because this involves having to micro manage your pet more by sending it to the back of the cave. Instead, once she starts walking move you and your pet to where your pet has been tanking her during P1, at the very back of the cave. Onyxia will now fly up into the air and start flying towards you while stopping to shoot fireballs at you. Ignore these, they are inconsequential. You probably won't get to do much dmg to her yet because right about now the first wave of whelps will spawn and come at you. They will come from both sides of the cave. Once the first whelp is about 5-10 yards out of the cave you hit FD. This will send them all back into their alcoves and give you an extra 10-20 seconds to dmg Ony. If you do this too late the whelps will be within agro range of your pet and will come and attack. If this happens I recommend staying FD'd. And resetting.\n\nOnce the whelps are inside their alcoves, stand up and pop Rapid Fire. Burn down Ony as hard as possible while keeping an eye on two things. First the whelp alcoves and second the entrance to the cave where large adds will eventually come. You're going top pop Readiness and be ready to FD at the first sight of a big add. This will coincide with the whelps coming at you for the second time. If the whelps are early pop Deterrence. When you see the big add enter the cave hit FD and it will walk out. Then get up, pop MD and Rapid Fire again and kill the whelps asap. Don't be bummed if this takes quite a few attempts to get right. All the time you're going yo want to keep an eye on the cave ent and save FD for the next big add. For this to work you need to keep your pet in the last 20% of the cave or the big add will see it and come in. If this happens it's not an automatic fail but it makes it harder.\n\nOnce the first wave of whelps are down start burning Ony down again. More whelps (though fewer than the first wave) will spawn again before you get her into P3 - unless you're super fast :) Get her to 40% and P2 ends she lands and no more adds will spawn.\n\n[b]P3[/b]: most will say that if you make it this far you will get her down as P3 is more or less just tank and spank like P1 save for a short duration fear which is very manageable. What CAN mess you up is if you still have adds alive from P2.\n\n5-6 whelps at 50% hp is fine. 10+ whelps plus a big add and most likely you'll die.\n\nI found this video that greatly helped me : http://www.wowhuntershall.com/2012/04/29/how-to-hunter-solo-onyxia-for-the-reins-of-the-onyxian-drake/\n\nWell, best of luck!", "date": "2012-05-07T11:20:14-05:00", "rating": 10, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-05-09T04:30:42-05:00", 2, "Bristlebane"]}

You can shield your shadowfiend if you think it will die before fade ends. When fade ends, start spamming holy nova and kite the whelps in circles until they die. Pain Suppression yourself if you need to, or just for the heck of it. Keep shielding for rapture during this time, refresh Grace with Penance, and stop to Greater Heal or Flash Heal yourself if you need to.[/li]\n\n[li][b]Onyxian Lair Guards:[/b] Just tank them and nuke them down with Holy Fire/Smite.

My current gear level is somewhere around the 450-460 range, but I also pulled it off in Ret spec as a fresh 90 in level 430ish gear.  No part of this fight is really that challenging anymore, nor does it take the 10-15 mins it used to.\n\n\n[s]\nJust recently (patch 5.04) started soloing her on my Pally in Prot spec.  Pretty easy, if not long, fight.  Couple thoughts:\n\n1) I use [spell=20165] for this fight.  Maybe if you're feeling saucy or if you're more skilled than I, [spell=31801] would be the right choice for you.  I can see how the latter would certainly shorten Phase 2, with the dot it applies, which is nice considering we can only hit her with Judgement, Avenger's Shield, and Holy Wrath.\n\n2) The biggest risk I've encountered comes in Phase 2 when the adds begin to spawn.  They usually do a little bit of damage to you and be ignored while you stay targeted on Onyxia herself.  If you ignore them for too long, though, you'll have a giant mass of adds that you won't be able to burst down due to the AOE damage cap, and that can spell out your doom.  Really, it's not very likely that you won't be able to mitigate or outheal the damage, but I felt it's worth mentioning since I died once or twice for that very reason (I wasn't paying enough attention).  I usually ignore the adds until the whelp waves hit, and then try to clear them out before going back to the boss.\n\nHappy hunting![/s]", "date": "2012-09-15T09:41:48-05:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-11-06T12:08:18-06:00", 1, "Fonzy"]}

Use frostbolts to heal your pet and make sure you don't pull aggro - this is accomplished by not hitting the boss yourself. Only heal your pet. Put the pet on focus and have a frostbolt @focus macro.

Drop a ring of frost just as the whelps reach you and put frost bomb on one, refresh Ice Barrier. Cast Frozen Orb into the pack.

I am ilvl479 in mostly 489 MSV/valor gear with a few pieces from heroic dungeons. I think it is doable with less gear but the more purples you have the better. It was an easy kill, but it took about 12 min maintaining a consistent 60k dps on the boss and adds. Expect your first kill to take around 10-15 min. \n\nHere's some tips:\n- Harvest Life, Dark Bargain, and Grimoire of Supremacy are mandatory talents. The former makes life so much easier on the whelps, Dark Bargain will useful when the adds become overwhelming, and GoSup provides a Voidlord as your tank. There's a lot of damage going out so anything that can help cushion it is a big bonus.\n- Glyph of Soul Shards, if you don't already have it, is required. Glyph of Siphon Life is also highly recommended due to the spamming of Soulburn: Seed of Corruption during the whelp phase.\n- As for consumables, I only had a basic [item=74644] and a health potion. It wasn't much, but I recommend bringing both because they are very useful. Obviously have a Healthstone on hand also. Bring flasks/pre-pots/drums only if you want a more efficient kill but they aren't necessary.\n\nOpen with your basic rotation but after this initial burst be conservative with your Soul Shards until phase 2. Try to maintain 2 Soul Shards at all times until phase 3: one for Seed of Corruption, and one for Harvest Life or Health Funnel to keep you or your Voidlord alive if either of you get low. Do not use Terrorguard/Abyssal yet. \n\nWhen phase 2 hits, try as best you can to maintain your DoTs on Onyxia. During this phase, Onyxia herself doesn't do too much damage so don't be afraid of having to dodge anything she throws at you. When the whelps come out, spam SB:SoC and Harvest Life: it should be enough to maintain your health at a healthy number. Once the big adds spawn, [i]direct your Voidlord to them and kill them as quickly as possible[/i] because they can pack a punch on a clothy. If there are whelps and big adds alive at the same time, apply SB: SoC as soon as the whelps come out and focus the big add. If you get low, you have plenty of cushions: Abyssal if there are too many adds, your defensive CDs, Healthstone, and health potion are all helpful.\n\nEventually you will hit Phase 3, and if there are any adds remaining kill them before focusing on Onyxia. Here, you can unload all of your CDs on her and do as much damage as you can, there is no need to be conservative about using your Soul Shards for Soul Swap or Haunt anymore. If you managed to save your Terrorguard CD, now would be the time to use it. While she won't be doing very much damage to you, keep an eye on your Voidlord. After a long fight, she will be dead and you can collect your shiny loot.\n\nApologies for the tl;dr nature of this post but I hope it will be useful to someone out there.

You don't have to worry about the adds, just nuke her, can kill her in like 1 min 20 with some timing and crit luck.\r\n\r\n2) Blood dk level 90, item level 484 full dps gear: also a speedkill, but I got tired of soloing 25-man, was also doable at 85, so no challenge at 90: I also use cooldowns such as DRW, ERW and dps trinket on 65% and even here I don't have to worry about the adds, I just nuke onyxia, and it takes 1 min 48 on a decent kill; if she doesn't go straight in p3, I just use blood boil, death coil, icy touch (death siphon is also useful).\r\n\r\n3) Prot paladin level 90, item level around 450, full dps gear except shield and 1 hand weapon: this was also doable at 86 in 371 item level, but now at 90 it takes 8-10 mins, I just use sacred shield and defensive cds while dpsing down onyxia in p1, lay on hands when I'm at 5% to not waste dps on her, and then in air phase I use avenger's shield and judgement and also word of glory (glyphed). P3 transition is not a big problem, just kill big adds as prio. Also done as ret, but took 1 more minute, so not worth it.\r\n\r\n4) Combat rogue level 90, item level around 450: I start with cds like shadow blades, adrenaline rush, troll racial, and keep recuperate up (also using evasion), when evasion ends I use preparation and activate combat readiness, and I also use killing spree on p1, does a bit of damage, so also heals with leeching poison. For p2 I chose shuriken toss (90 talent), so I can get her down quite fast, and I use evasion on whelps the first time. P3 transition must be quite precise here, avoid having too many whelps, you can have 1 big add, no problems. I use again evasion, preparation, evasion, combat readiness on onyxia, and in case cloak of shadows glyphed, and ofc dps cooldowns to get her before she kills me, takes like 6-8 mins in total.\r\n\r\n5) Arcane mage level 90, item level around 450: I start with arcane power (glyphed) and images to get her in p2, I don't use TW; then p2 is quite easy thanks to invocation talent, but I use nether tempest + arcane explosion spam to kill whelps. Then must be careful on p3 transition, adds up could mean a wipe, and I use time warp and arcane power again (and ofc images) on this phase, and if onyxia gets in melee range before she dies, I blink or iceblock while ice barrier is ready again and kite a bit, takes like 8-10 mins in total.\r\n\r\n6) and 7) Blood dk level 82, item level 267 and 309, however level 82 quest gear + 1-3 blues 415: these are the longest fights I do, 23-26 mins, and it's about kiting onyxia in p1 and using death siphon talent, only way to survive his damage; requires good blood dk experience, it's really hard, will need to use all cds in p1. Then p2 is a bit easier, I always save unholy blight and DRW for blood boil spam on the adds and the guardian when they come, in the meantime I outbreak and do some death siphon on onyxia, this is why it takes almost 30 mins; useful glyphs for this fight are VB and AMS for survival on p1 and p3, and glyph of outbreak for faster p2, as you can use it on onyxia each time it expires. P3 is again similar to p1, with this low dps you'll have to do a good transition again, but you can use army of the dead to distract the adds and kill them first. Then beating onyxia is just a matter of kiting and using cds wisely, like on p1.\r\n\r\n130 runs total so far, never saw the mount, and the reason I'm also doing it with level 82 blood dks is: dks are the only class which can solo it at 82 in this low level of gear, and furthermore they start at 55, so it's much faster; took me like 42 hours of levelling WITHOUT heirlooms to be ready to kill onyxia, if you feel unlucky and want more chars, blood dks are the way to go.", "date": "2012-12-07T19:36:05-06:00", "rating": 18, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Meanwhile you need to focus yourself on getting as much a runic power to blast Onyxia with [spell=47541] for extra damages. \nYou will have to stand as much as possible under Onyxia to ensure that when you dps both the whelps and the guardian that occasionally spawn you hit Onyxia too with your [spell=48721]. You also might want to be careful on the deep breath because it frankly could kill you. It's not hard to dodge though. \nWhen she finally goes down to ~41% quickly kill all remaining adds and then allow her to go into p3.\nP3: 40% to down.\nWell it's almost like the p1. The only difference being that she now fears you but if you have survived to this point I'm pretty sure you can't die from a few seconds of being feared and hit on your back and the eruptions that aren't very dangerous. The only 2 trikes I got from her in melee at this point was because I got feared and failed to refresh my [spell=77513]. When I finally killed her I had all my life and all the 89991 hp I could have as a shield from [spell=77513] (you cannot have more than 100% of your total life as a shield). \n\nI managed to down the boss with slightly less than 20k dps (considering than most of the fight was p2 and I couldn't hit the big turkey). On the almost 10 mins encounter I got hit for 452022 damages, 85% being Onyxia and only 4.1% of these damages being from melee. I also got 10% of the other overall damages from add that struck me on my back.\n\nI hope you will find this useful.

And I mean that literally, I only log out to sleep. I have been camping for a rare, which I have not found yet, but I found plenty of uncommon ones and lesser ones, when I first started a lot of people were camping as well, this is the main issue. Around 4:30-5am when no one was around the ENTIRE group of them respawned at once. I assume this happens on a very long respawn rate. I'm waiting to see when it happens again so I can know for sure, but it's 7:30am now and still no respawn. In fact I have not even seen any singular ones and I have not logged out yet. Although, I believe sometimes yesterday I saw a few single spawns, unless those were just missed ones from the major respawn.\n\nNo one else was around during the major spawn so I got a chance to check them all, and none were under 587 hp, which is the uncommon spawn. I hear the rare spawn is 732 or something like that, but that might be the rate after capture, I'm not sure if that changes or not but I haven't seen any anywhere near 700 in my two and a half days of camping. Anyone who knows the respawn rate for the big group, please let me know, or if there is any other information about the rares, like a certain area they spawn?\n\nThe spawn amount of the big group was around maybe 20 or more. It was a pretty huge group, all around the entire cave opening and into the swamps a bit, maybe even 30 of them.\n\nEDIT: It is now 10am and have not seen a single spawn again yet. At least a 5 hour spawn timer. I'm guessing it's more like 10-12 hours.\nEDIT: 10:50am and two showed up, one uncommon and another lesser one.\nEdit: 11:50am now and ever since the first two showed up there has been two or so spawning every 5-10 minutes or so. I assume it will be the same amount as the large group spawn except timed over a certain amount of time instead of all at once.\nStill no rares.\n\nUpdate: 12:55AM, Saturday, I found my first rare Spawn of Onyxia after three days of camping.

Pet battles usually only lasted 1 to 2 minutes.  I didn't track exactly if it was initiating the battle or ending the battle that started the 10-minute timer, suffice to say if you found one at 10:37, battled, and found another 10:41, and battled, you would again see one each at 10:47 and 10:51 respectively.  This is a pattern that went on for several hours.  If at any time one didn't spawn, that I saw, sure enough if I looked around hard enough I would find somebody else in the area ... usually doing their best to try to stay out of my sight by either flying through trees nearby or up much higher.  it's also easy to miss others since it's best to fly around solely looking at your mini-map for critters to pop up.\n\nI have identified 8 specific spawning sites.  The 3 most common locations, in order from best to worst (personal experience only) are the South side, Northwest point, Northeast point.  After nearly 18 hours of trying to find a rare Spawn, I finally found one ... and it was the one and only time I saw one on the exact East-side of the cave.  Not trying to imply anything about the East-side spawn, just telling it how it was.\n\nIt always spawns as a level 12.\n\nMy pet of choice to capture with it is my Rocket Chicken, as it will do 100-160 damage per hit with \"Missile\", and I can use a 50-80 point hit (\"Squawk\") when I need small amounts of damage to get the Spawn below 35% and ready for capture.  As a bonus, Squawk reduces damage taken for 3 rounds, and it's 3rd ability, Extra Plating, reduces damage for 2 rounds and produces zero damage.  I would cast Extra Plating when Spawn cast \"Dive.\"  I find I can usually tame it while using only the Rocket Chicken.  Since most people do not have this pet, I suggest something that has some defensive moves and/or heals.\n\nOnce I figured both spawns were on 10-minute timers, I adjusted my battle rate to get the second one to spawn shortly after I finished with the first one, so that I'd have 7-8 minutes between sets of spawns so that I could farm the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=4324]Searing Whelps[/url].  On my 82nd kill (according to Rarity addon), I received a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=10822]Dark Whelpling[/url] pet.\n\nIt should also be noted that it would usually take me 3 to 4 attempts to capture each Spawn, made more frustrating from the Spawns ability to heal large amounts.  It is recommended to get the achievement for capturing 50 battle pets and thus earn the use of the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=77/strong-trap]Strong Trap[/url] (or get the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=135/pristine-trap]Pristine Trap[/url], if possible).  This will speed up your process and reduce the number of headaches that occur.\n\nThe macro will save you a lot of time (due to not trying to capture Spawns that aren't Rare):\n[quote]/run hooksecurefunc(\"PlaySoundKitID\", function(Q) if Q==31584 then for i=1,C_PetBattles.GetNumPets(2) do SELECTED_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(C_PetBattles.GetName(2,i)..\" - \".._G[\"BATTLE_PET_BREED_QUALITY\"..C_PetBattles.GetBreedQuality(2,i)]) end end end) [/quote]\nCopy that macro and use it ONCE per login.

I went straight into battle with it! I was dearly hoping it was an uncommon or a rare, but with my luck it was a mere poor one. I was JUST about to catch it and it healed, so I had to throw another attack to weaken it. Nothing strong but just enough, but of course I had a critical hit! Down went the spawn and across my face went my hand.. \n\nI carried on going around and around, battling 80% of all the mice, spiders, snakes, toads, and rats I saw hoping it would speed up the spawn time and one of them would be an add with the battle. But nothing, 30mins passed of me circling. Hordes and Allies did the same hoping for one to show but they left after a while. I continued.\n\nNot even 45mins into the circling a spawn appeared! I dove in so no one could steal it from me, it was a mere poor but who cares! I caught it! Happy with myself and nothing to do, I decided to keep going. Not even a few feet after the enterance to the raid there was another! I dove in again before a horde could steal it, to my surprize it was a common! Hoping that the next would be an uncommon then a rare, I caught him and continued.\n\nA couple more poors and commons, I decided to log out for a bit and went onto my other toon to check its mail. Completely logging off I sat and played Officejerk on my iPod for a good 20mins before going back on, again, a couple more poors and commons.\n\nRoughly 30mins have passed, it's now been an hour into this, I feel like a volture circling a dead body.\n\nNothing so far, a horde has been here for awhile doing what I'm doing. I feel like its a race to the death on who gets it first, me circling one way and him another. Nothing, not a single spawn. I would be happy with an uncommon or a rare, I wouldn't care at this point.\n\nI feel as if I was going insane, going around and around and around. There hasn't been a single pet I could battle for a good 15mins.\n\nAh! a black rat! I went into battle hoping again to help the spawn time and get some of my sanity back.\n\nDrinking coffee and eating Halloween candy to keep me awake as I circle, I feel as if I was lost in a desert. Going in circles trying to find water but it never comes. Then all of a sudden, a spawn appeared! I rushed in and again, to my crappy luck it was a poor Spawn of Onyxia and a rare Chicken (which I already have) - oh have I wish it was the other way around.\n\nNext thing I know theres another, I walk over thinking its going to be nothing special and I go into battle.. AND ITS A RARE! I nearly yelled in joy! I went full out with my weak infected fawn (which I am using for these lower levels) - I got it's health down just enough and WHAM! I threw my strong trap and caught it! I did a bit of a dance (while trying not to fall off my bed)\n\nIt's only taken me an hour and 40-50 something minutes but I got it!\n\nNow I can take this little guy off to level him up to 25 to match my Corehound Pup and Celestial Dragon!\n\n\nYou just need some patience and time on your hands and you'll get the little guy!", "date": "2012-11-02T04:17:01-05:00", "rating": -5, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Downrated for playing Officejerk on yer IPod, I guess", "creationdate": "2012-11-04T03:01:55-06:00", "id": 595058, "rating": -1, "commentid": 1755356, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Thorngral", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Downrated for killing the first", "creationdate": "2012-11-06T22:10:37-06:00", "id": 596234, "rating": -2, "commentid": 1755356, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "akilleuss", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2012-11-02T04:26:24-05:00", 2, "Oshang"]}

I never camped in this section longer than 5 minutes then i would go on to my quest in capturing the seemingly invisible, non-spawning Minfernal.  \r\n\r\nI would do this routine on different times of the day.

I trembled when my mouse pointer indicated \"Spawn of Onyxia\". My mind went blank due to this unexpectation. \r\n\r\nFor a second, in anticipation, i did not know what to do.

Tail sweep is exceptionally strong when Spawn of Onyxia is slower than its opponent, so much so that you want to be going last when using this pet.\n\nThis means the best breed to aim for is #4 (P/P) because any points spent on speed are basically wasted. Breed #10 (P/B) is the second most favourable, and offers a few extra HP at the cost of attack power, but unfortunately still wastes some stats on speed. Breed #8 (P/S) is arguably the weakest.\n\nTactically, this pet works very well against most opponents, and does especially well against faster opponents (almost everything), aquatic and magic families and creatures with flying attacks. It also does well against opponents dependent on big attacks with long cooldowns, because it has two abilities to mitigate such attacks.\n\nThe key to using this pet well is being able to anticipate enemy actions (pretty much all the daily trainers, Pandarian elemental spirits and beasts of fable are very predictable once you get to know them) - and if you can plan 3-4 moves ahead, the Spawn of Onyxia is exceptionally adept against most opponents.\n\nThe standard rotation I employ with this little fella is as follows:\n\n[ul]\n[li]Open with a Tail Sweep[/li]\n[li]If your opponent hit in the first round, follow up with a Healing Flame, or alternatively, if your opponent didn't hit you in the last round, Tail Sweep again and wait a turn to heal once your opponent has actually hit you. Since the Spawn of Onyxia goes second your heal will heal for most of the first 2 attacks[/li]\n[li]Lift Off[/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep[/li]\n[li]Healing Flame[/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep until Healing Flame is available again, then start again because all your abilities will be off CD.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nI will however deviate from this rotation when I know my opponent has one or more key abilities.\n\nLift Off is very handy to dodge big attacks. For example use Lift Off on the same round that you know your opponent will use [url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=159] Burrow[/url]/[url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=564]Dive[/url]. Alternatively use it in the round before something like [url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=508]Moth Dust[/url] (hits hard and has a chance of putting your pet to sleep) or else anything that puts a nasty dot on you.\n\nSecondly, because Healing Flame adds additional healing equal to half of the last hit you took, it is often beneficial to time it for the rounds in which you know a big hit will land, but Lift Off is on CD.\n\nThirdly, the dragonkin special ability makes it do serious bonus damage (+50%) in the round after dealing any hit that leaves your opponent below 50% health. However this buff does not reapply itself if it is already active. If it drops off however, hitting an opponent again leaving it below 50% (or dead) will reapply the buff for another round. What this means is that if you trigger this buff with a hit that gets your opponent below 400 or so hp, it is often worth using either Healing Flame followed by a Tail Sweep, or alternative Lift Off, to get the killing blow. This would result in the buff being up for the first round against the next opponent, instead wasting the buff to do 600+ damage to a pet on 200 health.\n\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to own an Onyxian Whelpling, teaming it together with a Spawn of Onyxia makes for a duo that can reliably take down most daily trainer teams by themselves without even needing a third pet - meaning you can use them to power level your other pets.  Even against teams where this pairing is not ideal, I almost always have a spot for Onyxian Whelpling in my lineup. \n\nFor people who sadly don't have an Onyxian Whelpling available to them, Spawn of Onyxia is a great substitute, which does almost as well, and you'll definitely be wanting at least 2 of these. I strongly suggest saving a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=92683]Flawless Dragonkin Battle-Stone[/url] (or 2) for just this purpose, since farming for a rare of a specific breed can be somewhat time consuming and frustrating.", "date": "2013-04-10T10:37:04-05:00", "rating": 90, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wow.

After scanning the area, I found one pet on the southern side of the cave. What was irritating was that it was impossible to engage the pet in battle; the [i]\"Pet battle area is obstructed\"[/i] message came up regardless of where the dragon flew. The dragon's flight pattern was completely out of synch with the geometry of the surrounding area. At several points, the dragon actually [i]flew directly into the mountain[/i], as though the mountain was not even there. The pet could not  be seen, let alone engaged. \r\n\r\nEventually, I killed that pet, the only Spawn of Onyxia I could find, in hopes that it would cause another to spawn somewhere else. The tactic worked; on another circuit of the area, I found a Common white had spawned near the cave mouth. I had no problems engaging and capturing this second Spawn. If you encounter the problem I did, perhaps killing the uncapturable pet will cause another pet to spawn elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn a secondary note, this is just one of many \"pet battle area is obstructed\" messages I have encountered while trying to battle or capture pets in hilly or mountainous terrain. Considering it has been two years since MOP released, this issue is glaring. [u]Why does Blizzard consistently create pet spawns on terrain that is not suitable for battling?[/u] Dustwallow Marsh, Kun-Lai Summit, Grizzly Hills... these are just some of the areas with a high percentage of obstructed battle areas. Over and over I have patiently and methodically engaged multiple pets throughout their entire movement cycle, only to receive the \"pet battle area is obstructed\" message regardless of where I engage them in that movement cycle. It is an exercise in futility to find a rarely occurring animal and yet be unable to battle it.  I am surprised that Blizzard does not take these issues more seriously, and it causes me to question how much they even play their own product.\r\n\r\nWhatever section of Blizzard is responsible for QAing these pet spawns is ineffective at best and inept at worst. In any other profession, releasing a product that has a high percentage of non-working products is seen as an emergent issue that needs to be fixed immediately, or customers and revenue will be permanently lost. In contrast, Blizzard had had at least 24 months post-release to correct significant issues with pet battling, yet has a taken a unilateral attitude of \"We'll fix the issue when we get around to it.\"  There is no way in hell I could treat customers like that in my profession; I would be fired. \r\n\r\nYes, in theory WoW is just a game and not something \"serious\" like medicine, mechanical engineering, or contracting, but with millions of customers and billions of dollars in revenue over the last ten years, this is more than a game. WoW is a cultural influence. So why does Blizzard not thoroughly QA before release? Why do they expect paying customers to beta test the product for them? Over four years of playing, this uncomfortable conclusion is the one most consistent with the evidence I've seen. Maybe it is just a single Spawn of Onyxia that is poorly coded, but it feels more like an unsettling reminder that a once-trusted company has traded customer loyalty for financial profit. The administration really doesn't care how many customers they lose as long or how use-less the product becomes as their paychecks keep coming in. I got my Spawn of Onyxia, but I won't be coming back for another.

Tail sweep is exceptionally strong when Onyxian Whelpling is slower than its opponent, so much so that you want to be going last when using this pet.\n\n\nTactically, this pet works very well against most opponents, and does especially well against faster opponents (almost everything), aquatic and magic families and creatures with flying attacks. It also does well against opponents dependent on big attacks with long cooldowns, because it has two abilities to mitigate such attacks.\n\nThe key to using this pet well is being able to anticipate enemy actions (pretty much all the daily trainers, Pandarian elemental spirits and beasts of fable are very predictable once you get to know them) - and if you can plan 3-4 moves ahead, she is exceptionally adept against most opponents.\n\nThe standard rotation I employ with this little fella is as follows:\n\n[ul]\n[li]Open with a Tail Sweep[/li]\n[li]If your opponent hit in the first round, follow up with a Healing Flame, or alternatively, if your opponent didn't hit you in the last round, Tail Sweep again and wait a turn to heal once your opponent has actually hit you. Since the Spawn of Onyxia goes second your heal will heal for most of the first 2 attacks[/li]\n[li]Lift Off[/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep[/li]\n[li]Healing Flame[/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep until Healing Flame is available again, then start again because all your abilities will be off CD.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nI will however deviate from this rotation when I know my opponent has one or more key abilities.\n\nLift Off is very handy to dodge big attacks. For example use Lift Off on the same round that you know your opponent will use [url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=159] Burrow[/url]/[url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=564]Dive[/url]. Alternatively use it in the round before something like [url=http://www.wowhead.com/petability=508]Moth Dust[/url] (hits hard and has a chance of putting your pet to sleep) or else anything that puts a nasty dot on you.\n\nSecondly, because Healing Flame adds additional healing equal to half of the last hit you took, it is often beneficial to time it for the rounds in which you know a big hit will land, but Lift Off is on CD.\n\nThirdly, the dragonkin special ability makes it do serious bonus damage (+50%) in the round after dealing any hit that leaves your opponent below 25% health. However this buff does not reapply itself if it is already active. If it drops off however, hitting an opponent again leaving it below 25% (or dead) will reapply the buff for another round. What this means is that if you hit an opponent and get it below 25%, but don't kill it, it is often worth using either Healing Flame followed by a Tail Sweep, or alternative Lift Off, to get the killing blow. This would result in the buff being up for the first round against the next opponent, instead wasting the buff to do 500+ damage to a pet on 50 health.\n\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to own an Onyxian Whelpling, teaming it together with a Spawn of Onyxia makes for a duo that can reliably take down most daily trainer teams by themselves without even needing a third pet - meaning you can use them to power level your other pets.  Even against teams where this pairing is not ideal, I almost always have a spot for Onyxian Whelpling in my lineup. \n\nFor people who sadly don't have an Onyxian Whelpling available to them, Spawn of Onyxia (breed #4) is a great substitute, which does almost as well, and you'll definitely be wanting at least 2 of these. I strongly suggest saving a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=92683]Flawless Dragonkin Battle-Stone[/url] (or 2) for just this purpose, since farming for a rare of a specific breed can be somewhat time consuming and frustrating.", "date": "2013-04-10T10:57:35-05:00", "rating": 22, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2013-05-08T02:34:44-05:00", 1, "LSavage"]}

Villains are recurring characters in all kinds of books, movies, and games, it's natural. I'm not denying that they bring back charcters, I'm denying that they bring back characters with nothing but a \"merely a setback\" attitude. There are reasons and lore for most of the returns.\n\nBecause something is killed in game doesn't [i]always[/i] make it dead in the story, you have to separate things done for the sake of gameplay and things done for the sake of lore, which is sometimes awkward in an MMO setting.\n\nThings like the 3 San'layn Princes coming back. I don't view as them being \"brought back\". I see it as a continuation of the story.\n\n[ul]\n[li]The 3 Princes are resurrected by the Lich King to guard Lana'the after lengthy quest chains to kill them[/li]\n[li]Ragnaros/Gedon were just banished back to the plane of fire [/li]\n[li]Kil'jadaen was just pushed back into the Nether[/li]\n[li]There are quests explaining why Rivendare replaces Mograin in Naxx after it was moved by Kel'Thuzad. ([i]although we beheaded Rivendare in 1.10, the Lich King can reanimate pretty much anything it seems lol.[/i])[/li]\n[/ul]\n\nNow I'm not saying [b]SOME[/b] of the returns aren't a little weird, like Nefarian's return ([i]although there are a lot of  theories based on the Night of the Dragon book how he could be back, wouldn't be surprised if Death Wing had a hand in it either[/i]) and Anub'arak being undead for the 3rd time, there are usually reasons like \"this guy is such a legendary character that he deserves to be seen in a better/bigger setting\".\n\nOverall, I don't think it's a bad thing, and it's nothing to complain about as much as most players do all over the forums. It has [b]NOTHING[/b] to do with laziness like people whine about and [b]EVERYTHING[/b] to do with the story ([i]usually[/i]) or just letting a cool character get some more of the lime light ([i]less often but still a decent reason[/i]).
