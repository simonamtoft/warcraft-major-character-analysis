This might have actually been easier at lvl 80 in Wrath epics due to higer haste %\r\n\r\nMag is absolute cake, but getting the casters down is frustrating. I tried for about an hour to figure out a repeatable strat to get them down, and I finally came across one. Pure aoe didn''t work for me, and single target and tabbing didnt work - they all just healed through it\r\n\r\nProTip: summon your demonic circle outside the arena door and if you can't get the casters down, teleport out to reset.\r\n\r\nThe strat that worked for me:\r\n\r\nThe real trick I found is first to show thieir health bars with 'V'. Rather than tabbing through the mobs and hoping for low health, this lets you see who needs a nuke and who doesn't.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n\r\nPull the first mob, dot him up and put your felguard on him. As the others run in, dot them up with at least corruption and I recommend immo for the MC procs. Now Felstorm, pop Meta, drop an infernal on them, and hit immo aura. The trick is to look for the lowest health bar after they heal someone. They shouldn't all heal themselves because the first mob you were hitting will ultimately need their heals. For me, at least one mob was below half health or lower. Click on their health bar and nuke that mob dead. Keep repeating this and hopefully you can kill 2 or 3 while the mass aoe is still ticking. I suggest popping felstorm a second time when you spot a mob with low health and it's ready again. Essentially, you want to keep all of their health ticking down but all at different levels so they can't properly distribute their heals. By showing their health bars, you can see when they make a mistake and leave one mob low on health.  All the other strats i tried failed for me, and the first time i showed their health bars and did this, it worked. Once three of them were down, I didn't even have to try the others dropped like flys.\r\n\r\nIf I recall, by stats are something like gear level 339, ~9% haste ~15% crit ~14% hit\r\nMore haste would help nuke, but you need hit since everything is lvl ?.

Then they can be ignored. There's no way to kill them since they heal each other.[/li]\r\n[li]You want to be on the defensive or alternating between defensive and offensive (e.g., swapping between Seal of Insight and Seal of Corruption as well as Word of Glory and Inquisition) since the mobs are strong enough to kill you unless you're constantly healing yourself.[/li]\r\n[li]Do not put your back to the door.

Icing on the cake but not totally necessary for this fight, is bringing a spare set of two-handers both enchanted with Mending (though if you plan to do soloing past T4 content, dual-Mending will allow you to kill bosses that would otherwise be near impossible to solo as Fury. It has allowed me to solo some pretty tough customers, for example Gorefiend in BT).\r\n\r\nIf you are from the future and have managed to grab one or two Souldrinkers from the Dragon Soul raid, then SMF becomes the stronger solo choice, due to the incredible self-healing proc from this 1-handed weapon.\r\n\r\nAfter ensuring you have all you need to survive Mag's damage (food buffs, drums and elixirs/flasks always help), the next step is getting used to killing the heals-spamming Channelers before Mag activates. 2 approaches I can suggest to this:\r\n\r\n1 - Go ape sh1t with aoe, popping DW+Reck and make them spread their long cd heals all over the place, just keep aoeing and they will drop like flies, then pick off any stragglers.\r\n2 - Take them 1 by 1. Bring an add down to just above 50%, pool 100 rage, pop CS + Inner Rage and blow it up, move on to next (with FL level gear you probably won't even need CS to burst them fast enough).\r\n\r\nIf the Channelers went down smoothly and Mag hasn't activated yet, you can use the short break to bandage  up.
