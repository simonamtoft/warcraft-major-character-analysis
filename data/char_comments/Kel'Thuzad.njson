In addition this will splash over to any players in a 10 yard radius, if unlucky can chain the entire raid.\n\nPhase One:\n\nIn this Phase Kel'thuzad himself is untouchable, however once you step on the platform you'll swiftly notice that you are being surrounded by mobs in alcoves, make sure that you never touch any of these on purpose.\n\nDuring the first phase you'll see some of those mobs moving towards the centre against one of your raid members. The illusion here is that all the mobs that you see in the alcoves are static unless triggered by any of your raid members by miss-targeting or any random event these will de-spawn once phase two is initiated.\n\nThe mobs that are moving towards your raid are actually spawning in the alcoves, that's how you'll be able to pinpoint them and kill them as fast as possible.\n\nNow that you know this let's take a peek at what these creatures will do to you raid if not killed.\n\nSoldier of the Frozen Wastes:\n\n    * Dark Blast: Once it reaches its target it will explode causing 1750-2250 to the raid.\n    * Once it reaches its target it will die along with the Dark Blast.\n\nUnstoppable Abomination:\n\n    * Mortal Wound: Similar to Fankriss, this de-buff will decrease the amount of healing done on the target by 10% stacking up to 99 times.\n    * In addition these will hit regular hits for 3000-5000 damage do not grab aggro from the tanks.\n\nSoul Weaver:\n\n    * Wail of Souls - 4250-5750 Shadow damage, in addition knocking them away from each other.\n    * One she reaches her target she will do the shadow damage and knock the 3 closest targets 3 yards.\n\nWhat you'd want to do now is to assign all your hunters assisted by a couple of healers to clear out the Soldiers of the Frozen Wastes (the skeletons). These guys have virtually no HP and move at a normal walk speed.\n\nIn addition to take care of the Unstoppable Abominations you'll need to have a tank rotation just large enough to drop the de-buff on the first tank that tanked them. Drag these Abomination into the centre of the circle, do not worry they don't do any AoE damage; send all your Melee DPS on them since they have a respectable amount of HP, these guys also move on normal walk speed.\n\nAnd Last but not least the Soul Weavers, place every single mage warlock and what ever ranged you can spare on these, they have a respectable amount of HP and they walk very very slowly.\n\nDuring the 5 minutes phase one lasts the mobs will spawn at faster rate, so you're raid will be pressured for time. The basic idea is to get rid of most of the mobs once Kel'thuzad spawns, having 1 Abomination and 2-3 soul weavers alive when he spawns is within the ok limits, preferably having one of each is the best.\n\nMake sure everything is under control and don't loose track of your ass.", "date": "2006-12-13T14:10:02-06:00", "rating": 138, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Your guild site link is broken, it's for sale", "creationdate": "2016-01-05T17:42:08-06:00", "id": 923128, "rating": -2, "commentid": 14865, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Maximborn", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "@Maximborn It's a 10 year old comment...", "creationdate": "2016-08-23T19:31:52-05:00", "id": 962788, "rating": 7, "commentid": 14865, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 256, "username": "leobolin", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

He initiates the cast of this spell by a unique animation, watch learn and counter it each time he trys to do it.\n\nThe best way to do this is:\n\nAs you may see in the picture the four green circles represents four melee interruption groups consisting of one warrior and one rogue in each placed at maximum melee range in the shape that is presented. These four groups will ALWAYS stay in no matter of the frost blast timer, if any of these groups should get hit only two people will be frost blasted at any given time. The rest of the melee squad will have to move out when the frost blast timer is ready preferably to their group healer and out of harms way to chain it on any other players.\n\nThis will be assisted by the mages that will counter-spell him as well, ask in the Loatheb fight they should have some kind of macro to notify who is on cooldown and which mage is next in line to counterspell.\n\nWhile this is being done everyone else needs to avoid the Shadow Fissure, mana detonation and Frost Bolt-Nova, as in the Sapphiron formation you'll need to have a priest in every group out-healing the nova damage.\n\nThe Shadow fissure is one of the easiest abilities to avoid; we strongly recommend that you set your spell details up to maximum, once he casts it on you it will show a huge red circular animation with a lot of smokes poring out of it:\n\nThe only thing that you need to do is move 5 yards in any direction away from it wait 5 seconds and move back.\n\nSecondly you'll need to avoid the mana detonation, since the room is small your raid will probably make use of every inch of it, the best way is to really be awake and see what's going on around you and move away from any players that gets it, or clear a path for him into the alcoves.\n\nThirdly you'll need to counter the frost blast, this spell is very much like the Emeriss Corruption of the Earth only difference here is that you have to rely on someone to save your life if you should get hit by it.\n\nBasically you'll have a healer in every corner make sure to heal the frost blasted targets as fast as possible any amount of healing will do, most of the times sine several healers are healing you and hopefully you've been standing 10 yards from anyone else which in turn means that you're the only one that got frost blasted, however 2-3 targets are common and easily saved, any more than that and people will start to die.\n\nFinally you'll need to keep the people that get mind controlled in check, by any means necessary, fear stun polymorph anything to keep them out of the game during this period.\n\nIn addition the mind control will take the primary tank with it, wiping any threat he's made over the fight. In any case you'll need tanks waiting idly by to go in and grab him. Make sure to cease all and any type of DPS during this period not to make him run amok. Once the secondary tank has him you can open up dps again.\n\nIf you manage to keep this up until 40% you'll enter phase three.", "date": "2006-12-13T14:11:20-06:00", "rating": 101, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Of the Kirin Tor's leaders, Kel'Thuzad was the most eager to gain access to the Guardian's Library \u2014 the depository of knowledge hoarded by Medivh in his tower of Karazhan \u2014 and thus was most upset when the library was lost. After Medivh's death, Kel'Thuzad and the other senior members of the Kirin Tor questioned Medivh's apprentice, Khadgar, about what happened; Kel'Thuzad seemed particularly interested in discovering more about the mysterious Order of Tirisfal, which \u2014 as he pointed out to Antonidas, the leader of the Kirin Tor \u2014 was relevant when discussing Medivh.\r\n\r\nCall Of The Lich King: There were a handful of powerful individuals, scattered across the world, who heard the Lich King's mental summons from Northrend. Most notable of them was the Archmage Kel'Thuzad, of the magical nation of Dalaran. Kel'Thuzad, one of the senior members of the Kirin Tor \u2014 Dalaran's ruling council \u2014 had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy. Driven to learn all he could of the magical world and its shadowy wonders, he was frustrated by what he saw as his peers' outmoded and unimaginative precepts. Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he vowed to learn what he could from the immensely powerful Lich King. \r\n\r\nForsaking his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Travelling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend. Intent on reaching Icecrown and offering his services to the Lich King, the archmage passed through the ravaged, war-torn ruins of Azjol-Nerub. Kel'Thuzad saw firsthand the scope and ferocity of Ner'zhul's power. He began to believe that allying himself with the mysterious Lich King would not only be wise, but potentially fruitful. \r\n\r\nAfter long months of trekking through the harsh Arctic wastelands, Kel'Thuzad finally reached the dark glacier of Icecrown. He boldly approached Ner'zhul's dark citadel and was shocked when the silent undead guardsmen let him pass as though he was expected. Kel'Thuzad descended deep into the cold earth and found his way down to the bottom of the glacier. There, in the endless cavern of ice and shadows, he prostrated himself before the Frozen Throne and offered his soul to the dark lord of the dead. \r\n\r\nThe full version of his flight from Dalaran and encounter in Icecrown, where he meets Anub'arak and realizes, too late, the full plans of the Lich King, is told in the short story, The Road to Damnation. \r\n\r\nThe Lich King was pleased with his latest conscript. He promised Kel'Thuzad immortality and great power in exchange for his loyalty and obedience. Kel'Thuzad, eager for dark knowledge and power, accepted his first great mission: to go into the world of men and found a new religion that would worship the Lich King as a god. \r\n\r\nTo help the Archmage accomplish his mission, Ner'zhul left Kel'Thuzad's humanity intact. The aged, yet still charismatic wizard was charged with using his powers of illusion and persuasion to lull the downtrodden, disenfranchised masses of Lordaeron into a confidence. Once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be \u2014 and a new figurehead to call their king...\r\n\r\nCult Of The Damned: Kel'Thuzad returned to Lordaeron in disguise, and over the span of three years, he used his fortune and intellect to gather a clandestine brotherhood of like-minded men and women. The brotherhood, which he called the Cult of the Damned, promised its acolytes social equality and eternal life on Azeroth in exchange for their service and obedience to Ner'zhul. As the months passed, Kel'Thuzad found many eager volunteers for his new cult amongst the tired, overburdened laborers of Lordaeron. Surprisingly, Kel'Thuzad's goal to pervert the citizens' faith in the Holy Light towards belief in Ner'zhul's dark shadow was easily attained. As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to keep its workings secret from the authorities of Lordaeron at every turn. \r\n\r\nWith Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague energies into a number of portable artifacts called Plague Cauldrons, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages. The cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague generators, sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron. \r\n\r\nThe Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves. The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge \u2014 for soon, it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world.", "date": "2008-07-21T19:13:03-05:00", "rating": 164, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I was going to upvote this, but it's standing on 111 votes and now I'm conflicted", "creationdate": "2016-03-25T05:53:47-05:00", "id": 935509, "rating": -9, "commentid": 332361, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Calirion", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

From there he quickly fled and they followed him back to Andorhal, where he told Arthas of Mal'ganis in Stratholme. Arthas, in a rage, hunted Kel'Thuzad down and killed him, but not before Kel'thuzad told him his death would mean little. But they were not finished yet. \r\n\r\nArthas betrayed his kingdom and become a servant of the Lich King. Kel'Thuzad began to appear to him as a ghostly apparition after his protector, Gavinrad the Dire, was slain by Arthas and Kel'thuzad's remains were reclaimed. He appeared only to Arthas, and told him that he was not to trust the dreadlords, promising to explain all of the Lich King's plans to Arthas once he walked the earth again in Quel'Thalas. \r\n\r\nKel'Thuzad watched over Arthas as he made the slow procession to the Sunwell in Silvermoon against the stratagems of Sylvanas Windrunner. Eventually, Arthas ravaged his way through the two Elfgates and finally laid siege to Silvermoon itself, breaching through to the fabled Sunwell. Arthas placed Kel'thuzad's remains within the well, and with the help of Tichondrius, Kel'Thuzad was reborn into the terrifying form of a lich. \r\n\r\nAs they traveled to Alterac, Kel'Thuzad explained that the Scourge was merely the harbinger of the Burning Legion, and that he would summon the first of the demons, the eredar warlock Archimonde to the mortal world. After slaying the orcs guarding the Demon Gate, Kel'Thuzad communed with the dark lord who told him that he must go to Dalaran and steal the Book of Medivh. \r\n\r\n \r\nContact with ArchimondeAfter Arthas led the attack on Dalaran and killed Antonidas, the book was retrieved and Kel'Thuzad began the lengthy summoning process, with Arthas defending him from the many attacks of Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. When all was complete, Archimonde stepped through the portal and was free to act according to his plans. His first act was to promote Tichondrius to leader of the Scourge, rendering Arthas and Kel'Thuzad of little use. However, Kel'Thuzad, confident in the Lich King's grand design, disappeared amidst the chaos of Dalaran's destruction.\r\n\r\nAfter The War: Kel'Thuzad resurfaced as the Legion raked across the Plaguelands, and in the aftermath of the invasion, he remained in the Capital as one of the Lich King's lieutenants. Arthas had gone to Kalimdor on Ner'zhul's command, and so only Kel'Thuzad and the banshee Sylvanas Windrunner remained in his stead. But they knew that the Legion was defeated long before the Dreadlords who remained in Lordaeron did. \r\n\r\nArthas returned in a fury and chased the dreadlords out of the Capital, and Kel'Thuzad was relieved to see him. With the Legion's generals gone, they turned to the human villages who were escaping to the mountain passes. Kel'Thuzad thought that perhaps they would be a fitting sacrifice to the Lich King. But as they cut a swath through the human forces, Arthas suffered some violent seizures, and Kel'Thuzad considered recalling their forces, but the King forbade it, and they continued on their macabre mission. In the aftermath, Arthas received a vision from Ner'zhul, who told him to return to Northrend. Kel'Thuzad immediately prepared for his departure, but they were abruptly ambushed by the dreadlords, and separated. The dreadlords unleashed their forces against Arthas, but Kel'Thuzad found his own way out of the city. \r\n\r\nKel'Thuzad later came upon Arthas in the clutches of Sylvanas and her wicked banshees. She was about to strike when Kel'Thuzad unleashed his forces against her and her sisters. With the banshees dead, Sylvanas was forced to retreat. Kel'Thuzad escorted Arthas to the shore, where he had prepared a fleet of ships for his departure. Arthas asked Kel'Thuzad, as his most loyal servant and twisted friend, to remain in Lordaeron and ensure that his legacy remain. Kel'Thuzad swore on what was left of his life to carry out that mission at any cost. In the battle that would follow between Sylvanas and the dreadlords, Kel'Thuzad took his forces into hiding, where he would plot his resurfacing into the new powers of the Plaguelands. He now resides in his necropolis Naxxramas, above Stratholme.\r\n\r\nAll This Leading up to his Wow Encounter.", "date": "2008-07-21T19:15:23-05:00", "rating": 63, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Here is what I observed from healing the 10 and 25 player variants.  I want to put up preliminary information, so when someone makes a more comprehensive post, vote this one down.\n\nFor phase 1, the abominations, skeletons, and banshees remain.   The banshees will aoe and knockback the entire raid when they get in range of their primary aggro target.  Focus them down when they are up.  The adds ramp up as phase 1 nears completion, and there were several adds up when Kel'Thuzad became active.\n\nFor phases 2 and 3, Chains of Kel'Thuzad has been removed for KT10 only.  He seems to cast aoe frost bolt every 15 seconds or so, and uses frost blast about every 45-60 sec.  Spread out throughout the phase to minimize frost blast impact.  Because of spreading out, not all healers will have range upon frost blast so NS rotations are not feasible.  For the 10 player variant, we had two druids who were able to rejuv the entire raid before each frost blast.  This way we could swiftmend/nourish the victims - casting regrowth seemed too sluggish.  Do not underestimate the danger of frost blast.  I believe we dedicated 1 shaman to raid healing.  In 10, detonate mana was of little consequence because we were already spread out.  For 25, it was an issue once or twice. \n\nThere were two adds when phase 3 started in 10.  We found that healing the offtank during phase 3 did not add too much additional stress for healers, until about 3-5 minutes in.  It is important to have adequate dps to finish off the boss before the offtank becomes unhealable.  In 25, our paladin tank just tanked KT and the adds and lived fine.\n\nWe thought the encounter was fun in its current state.  The biggest problem we had was failing to spread out for frost blast, and slow heals on frost blast victims.\n\n[u]Edit 4/30/09[/u] -- I think the most dangerous situation in this encounter is when a the melee [b]all get the frost blast[/b] (a.k.a. the ice block) because they weren't spread out.  I often found that any two aoe heals (wild growth and circle of healing) together can keep almost anyone alive.  Tanks are a major exception to this rule - if the melee also get your tank tombed, the tank will need more healing due to higher max health.  Normally in my raids two druids wg the melee and they are fine.", "date": "2008-10-13T12:15:49-05:00", "rating": 31, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Just done kel on naxx10, hardly doable with more than 4 melees, since for avoid chaining frostblast (should have a 5-10y range) you've to stand at max range from the hitbox  also tricky if the offtank gets frostblasted in phase3, got 1 wipe for that, and it's completely luck-based", "creationdate": "2008-10-19T17:24:27-05:00", "id": 355615, "rating": 1, "commentid": 404753, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "mrgamer", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-04-30T19:28:48-05:00", 3, "xander"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 41, "id": 484959, "nreplies": 3, "sticky": 0, "user": "262206", "body": "For the 10 man fight, very simple but very luck based. Heres how it goes:\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Everyone moves to the middle of the room, Kel will not attack and can't be attacked for this period. Waves of undead will come at you from all sides. Ranged go on the Skeletons (1600 hp, 1 hit and dead) and the banshees. It is imperative that the banshees not make it to the groups, however it is not difficult to accomplish. The melee will go on the Abominations. The waves last for 4 and a half minutes. Very simple phase.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: The targeted/raid frost bolts dont hurt much, a shaman with frost totem or a pally with frost aura is plenty. Chains isnt used in 10 man. Mana Det isnt much of an issue, just have the ranged stay 10 yards from each other. Shadow fissure is very obvious and very slow to start damaging floor effect. When you see one under you, back out for a few seconds till its gone, and back to your original spot. Only issue with this is when MT gets the Fissure, he needs to rotate around Kel just enough to be outside the Fissure damage zone. Melee must rotate with him. The only remotely dangerous attack is Frost Blast. Wont be used on MT. He will target one random person and insta nuke them with this. 104% of their max life is delt over 5 seconds. Anyone within 10 yards of the target will also take a FB, and it will chain. This is the reason for a max of 4 melee in your raid. Only 4 people can be out of 10 yards of each other and melee Kel Thuzad. Between lag, human response time and the GCD the only heal you really have time for is an instant safely. The target MUST have some kind of healing in 2 seconds or they are dead and you need everyone alive for phase 3 till you out gear the instance. FB can not be bubbled or Ice Blocked out of, so no get out of jail free card for mages and pallies. If your healers are quick enough on FB, this phase is cake. Just conserve mana.\r\n\r\nPositioning is absolutely key to this fight at this point. One MT tanks Kel in the middle. Melee is set up in a 4 point diamond around Kel. One melee in each spot at MAX range. If you have 5+ melee in your raid, your best bet is honestly just to have the OT sit in a corner or something. Everyone else should just spread out as much as they can making sure everyone is in heal range, making sure not to stand behind a melee so if he has to back out of a Fissure he can without risking 2 people getting hit with FB at once. \r\n\r\nPhase 3: At 40% Kel will yell for help and 2 adds will come. Cant be CC'd in the 10 man version. The OT picks them up and sits on them, they despawn when Kel dies. At this point it becomes a DPS race, but not for the right reasons. The adds do increasing damage over time, and will eventually kill your OT, then wipe your raid. However you can easily beat the timer in heroic blues. The real reason that it becomes a DPS race is Kel can still use FB on your OT! There is no way to prevent it and if it happens its almost a guaranteed wipe. Save your blood lust, wings, IV, etc for this phase. If you luck out and your OT isnt insta-gibbed in the 3-5 FBs you will take in this phase you should be OK.\r\n\r\nKel has higher gear requirements than the rest of the zone, and a very annoying 4 man cap on the melee, but is far from the toughest fight to learn in the instance. Grobb, Heigan and the 4 Horsemen are all tougher fights to learn.

[b]The main tank should also tank the adds[/b].\r\n\r\nAs a tank, my job is to eliminate random chance as a factor in a boss fight as much as possible. That's why I made sure I was uncrittable before entering my first Northrend raid. That's why (as a paladin) I worked so hard to hit 102.4% pre-[i]Wrath of the Lich King[/i]. Manageable predictability is always better than significant risk of an unmanageable event.\r\n\r\nIf the odds were 1%, or even 5%, that the off tank keeping the adds busy would get ice blocked during the fight, the risk would be acceptable. But in a fight in which the adds appear when the boss is still at 40% health, and every 45-60 seconds there is a 11% (1/9) chance that the off tank is ice blocked, likely killing him (due to the sudden Frost Blast damage on top of the adds' attacks) and, at the least, certainly causing the adds to run rampant? Unacceptable. Having the main tank also handle the adds eliminates this risk. There is no net increased healing pressure, overall; if anything, healers become more efficient because a) there's only one tank and b) there is less overhealing.\r\n\r\nWhat should the off tank do, instead? If there's room around the boss for another melee, he should stay second on Kel'Thuzad and the adds' threat tables, in case the main tank gets killed. If there's no room, he should find a quiet corner, stay alive (if druid or paladin, help heal), and be prepared to jump into the fight.", "date": "2009-01-10T04:49:23-06:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Whether a mage has a huge crit, a warlocks DoTs tick, or a Holy Light nails someone for 20k, someone is likely to pull aggro.  A good idea is to have anyone with interrupt abilities (Shaman, Rogues, Warriors, Warlock pet macros, even Mages) tick on KT after his MC cooldown timer is up and wait to cast their interrupts when he targets someone and starts a frostbolt.  Make sure to stop using these abilities shortly before the MC cooldown is up to make sure they are off of their cooldown.  In the 2-4 seconds spent interrupting these frost bolts, the tank should likely be able to regain control of the boss.\r\n\r\nThis is only important for those trying to get [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2138]Heroic: Glory of the Raider before[/url] 3.1 comes out and they remove the special mounts from the game.

I will try again with proper buffs (Food buff for regen flask for SP or regen, it really didnt matter TBH) and try to hit the enrage timer :P \n\nTo any other people who want to try and solo him, kudos to you and good luck :)\n\nEdit: By the way, he never does frost blast on you if you have aggro on him, so that was the reason I was able to stay alive for so long.", "date": "2010-07-12T17:08:15-05:00", "rating": -2, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-07-12T17:09:16-05:00", 1, "Moethetroll"]}

The flask either made a huge difference, or I was a lot luckier with rng on the kill, which came after a wipe at 123k hp. As with any soloing, I removed Glyph of Frenzied Regeneration. For this, I replaced it with glyph of feral charge, which might be useful for killing the banshees because of their stupid knockback.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 is straight forward, kill the adds that come at you. Focus aboms first and then banshees whenever possible. In my gear, the aboms died fast enough that the mortal wound was never an issue. Once Kel'thuzad activates, there will probably be 3 or 4 banshees left. These banshees are really annoying and should be dealt with before really focusing on KT. You really don't want to let them get close to each other, or they will be more difficult to kill. While focusing on the banshees, you should also interrupt KT's Frostbolts whenever Skull Bash is off CD. What I did was sit on KT until he would cast a frostbolt, and skull bash it. Then I'd run to a banshee and hit it with a mangle/maul combo, get knocked back, feral charge and do it again. This was usually enough to kill them or at least get them very low. Then I'd go back to KT to interrupt another frostbolt and repeat the process. A really low banshee can be finished off with a faerie fire from a safe distance.\r\n\r\nOnce KT is alone, it's straight forward again. Get out of shadow fissures, interrupt frostbolts whenever you can, and use defensive cooldowns whenever appropriate. In my gear level, my hp went down pretty slowly, but it went down nonetheless, so I used FR and SI twice each before phase 3. I only used berserk once after killing the last of the banshees and then saved it for phase 3. \r\n\r\nOnce phase 3 starts and the adds get to you, use berserk and manglespam. Then just continue as you did in p2. At first the adds won't be a problem at all, but eventually, your hp will start going down more quickly. At around 60% hp, use Frenzied Regeneration to fill up.

Here are a few pointers: Phase 1 is simple, kill the adds, if you have any remaining adds during phase 2, kite KT Around and kill the adds by using Outbreak. Phase 2 is Frost Bolt and Shadow Fissure. Interrupt Frostbolt as much as you can and when you cant, pop Anti-Magic Shield. Shadow Fissures: Stay out of them. Phase 3 is a huge burn phase save ALL Cooldowns until Phase 3.\n\nHow the fight works (Descriptive):\n\nPhase 1 -\n\n You are in the center fighting off skeletons, abominations, and Soul-Weavers. Skeletons & Abominations are easy, just kill them. Soul-Weavers become the problem, they have a knock back which is followed by minor shadow damage. Just throw Outbreak on them, hit Death Strike, run away, repeat.\n\nPhase 2 -\n\n This is the easiest phase, the first part maybe difficult due to remaining adds. Again, Soul-Weavers, Outbreak, Death Strike, Run away, repeat. There are only two things after all the adds are dead that you have to worry about, Frostbolt, and Shadow Fissures. You will NOT be Ice Blocked or Mind-Controlled IF you are by yourself. (Excluding pets.) Interrupt Frostbolt with Mind Freeze, and when you cant, pop Anti-Magic Shell. DPS him down to 45-50% HP. This is the longest phase.\n\n Phase 3 -\n\n This is the HARDEST phase, everything is the same except now Guardian's of the Icecrown arrive. As SOON as you see him yell \"Master I require aid!\" Pop Army of the Dead, Rise Ghoul, everything you got. And burn him. The Guardians get stacks increasing their damage done each time they attack you. They have 2.5Mil HP Each so do not kill them, focus on Kel the whole time. Keep your Blood Shield up at all times. Be warned, the longer it takes for you to kill Kel the more stacks those adds have and the increased chance of you dieing.\n\nGood luck, if you did it right, you get to see a little shadow orb on the ground with fancy loot :D", "date": "2011-10-11T08:57:42-05:00", "rating": 25, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This technique is flawless, except from own experience, I can say it's best to pop your army, ... at 20%, that distracts the adds, giving you a full nuke on KT and you are able to stack your blood shield quite easily.

I think it is a world first for that spec as I could not find any reference. Likely nobody has been stupid enough to do it as MM, as BM is so much easier. I however wanted to see if it was possible as MM for the challenge. :-)\n\nAs BM just let him iceblock you, and your spirit pet will save you. Fairly easy fight that way with little issues. So I though what if I do it again as MM?\n\nTook me roughly 20 tries, using the same tactic as hunters at lvl 85 used, using LoS, but I got it in the end. Non-hunters with per classes (warlocks might be able to use a similar method.)\n\nMain issue with this boss is that for hunters it is impossible to dismiss pet and just tank and spank. Not enough selfheal or damage reduction. (At 10 man you can just nuke though). With pet however, he'll iceblock and mindcontrol you all the time as you will be the main agro target. Back in the days hunters solved this at 10 man by LoS him and let the pet burn him down as much as possible and zerg the final part.\n\nI tried if I could do the same at lvl 90 and with some modifications you can:\n\n1) Be alert that his [b]first[/b] mind control ignores LOS and casts on you if you are in range. Perhaps bug, but I lost a few attempts due to this when I was absolutely without a shred of doubt not in LoS.\n\n2) Also be alert his phase does not start at 3.48 as many people incorrectly claim, but is actually variable depending on adds spawn. I had times ranging from 3.43 to 4.22 when he would 'Strike'. \n\nI mention this as I recommend using a stopwatch to keep track of his time for enrage. He'll enrage around 19 mins from start (including trash killing). \n\nAlso because if you go for the 18 adds achievement, like I did, you want to know when he strikes. You can be unlucky with adds being left around.\n\n3) Tank pets are out of the question, as they will take to long to burn him down, with no way to beat the enrage. You'll need a ferocity. I used hyena as the haste buf makes him the higest dps pet. This automatically means you'll need to glyph mend pet as else he'll die in the second part of the fight.\n\nSo tactic:\n\nP1: just nuke adds. I went for the 18 adds kill achievement as well.\n\nP2 After somewhere around 3:45-4:15 he'll strike. Now is the hard part. You must set you pet to passive and position you pet so you can heal and be still LoS him. This is hard and partly dependend on RNG and will cost you a few tries. I went in the third quarter while putting the pet next to the pilar betwen 1st and 2nd quarter.\n\nWhat I did is at 3:40 already pre-position my pet way back in a corner to be safe. When he strikes, MD. He'll never run to your pet but stays at range, hence the RNG on where exactely he stops moving. You run around a corner, set docus to boss and give the command to attack.\n\nIn addition, even if you are not in LoS, remember to wait at least 30 secs before getting back in range to heal your pet, as you'll get mind controlled regardles of LoS. This is only the first few seconds the case! (Again perhaps a bug, but it is not me messing up, as I was behind a wall a few times.)\n\nYou'll fail a few times, but get better in it. Once you got him into that position, you must use Stampede, Murder of Crows and other abilities (e.g traps) to damage him, else your beat will not beat the enrage. Each time he does his frost spell castbar you have a few seconds when you are safe to attack. One misstep and you are dead though ...\n\nSpam mend pet to keep pet up in between.\n\nP3: At 45% adds come. If you are not before 14 minutes you are likely too late and better dismiss, FD and repeat. You'll not make it as you need to burn these adds down. Yes kill them, not just MD to you pet as even a glyphed mend pet won't keep your pet up. These adds stacking buf will kill your pet and they you. Remember you are using a non-tank pet.\n\nI MD'd two adds to my pet and killed the others. Then killed the two on my pet. Remember to spam mend pet, else he will die.\n\nIf all goes well, you'll be at 18-18:30ish minutes with the final add down.. Dismiss pet and zerg teh last part of the health of the boss. I killed him with less than a 5% of hp and 4 seconds before the enrage timer.\n\nOh and don't use stampede during the final zerg, as it counts as a pet and he'll iceblock you.\n\n[b]Moral of this story: Unless you like that stuff, just go BM.[/b]\n\n\nUPDATE: sad I got voted down. It seems giving tips on how to solo something on a non-optimal spec plus various other generic sofar undocumented (!) information on timing and abilities is not allowed. Or people were put of by the 'world first' comment? Well, I was not bragging, and as far as I know it is still the truth as well ... Next time I'll only post a \"I also just did it as BM comment\".

OR the man behind the curtain!), and go up the ramp to the blue vestibule.\n\nYou will see one blue portal orb which, when clicked, will port you to Sapphiron's Lair.\n\nTo return, use the similar orb in Sapphiron's Lair.\n\nOBTW, does anyone else get extremely annoyed with the way that text in comments and replies [b]throws away[/b] one of the grammatically MANDATORY [u]two[/u] spaces between sentences?

For example, the first incentive for Kel'Thuzad to study Necromancy was to be prepared and ready to deal with the orcish necromancers/warlocks in case of a war and not his obsession with power. \n\nAfter reading the whole story, you might feel a bit like I did and sympathize with Kel'Tuzad! After all, the Kirin Tor never even thought about giving him a chance to prove that necromancy could be used against their enemies and not only to raise zombies. \n\nAlso, it seems to me that he didn't [b][i]willingly[/i][/b] trade his soul to the Lich King. The curiosity leading him to Northrend, in order to figure out about the strange voice, led him to Naxxramas and to the Lich King, who wanted to use him in order to spread the plague.
