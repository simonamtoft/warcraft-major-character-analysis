Then he saw that the master mage\u2019s hair was in disarray, and his lambent green eyes were wide and angry.\r\n\u201cThief!\u201d shouted Medivh, pointing at Khadgar. \u201cInterloper!\u201d The elder mage pointed at the younger and began to intone a string of alien syllables, words not crafted for the human throat.\r\nDespite himself, Khadgar raised a hand and wove a symbol of protection in the air in front of him, but he\r\nmight as well have been making a rude hand gesture for all the effect it had on Medivh\u2019s spell. A wall of\r\nsolidified air slammed into the younger man, bowling over both him and the chair he sat in. The grimoires\r\nand primers went skating along the surface of the table like boats caught in a sudden squall, and the notes\r\ndanced away, spinning.\r\nSurprised, Khadgar was driven back, slammed into one of the bookshelves behind him. The shelf itself\r\nrocked from the force of the blow, and the youth was afraid it would topple, spoiling his hard work. The\r\nbookcase held its position, though the pressure on Khadgar\u2019s chest from the force of the attack\r\nintensified.\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d thundered Medivh. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young mage struggled against the weight on his chest and managed to speak, \u201cKhadgar,\u201d he gasped. \u201cAssistant. Cleaning library. Your orders.\u201d Part of his mind wondered if this was why Moroes spoke in such a shorthand fashion.\r\nMedivh blinked at Khadgar\u2019s words, and straightened like a man who had just been woken from a deep sleep. He twisted his hand slightly, and at once the wave of solidified air evaporated. Khadgar dropped to his knees, gasping for air.\r\nMedivh crossed to him and helped him to his feet. \u201cI am sorry, lad,\u201d he began. \u201cI had forgotten you\r\nwere still here. I assumed you were a thief.\u201d\r\n\u201cA thief that insisted on leaving a room neater than he found it,\u201d said Khadgar. It hurt a little when he\r\nbreathed.\r\n\"\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\u201cThe Magus does not need an assistant,\u201d muttered Khadgar, clearing a space at the end of one table and pulling out a chair. \u201cHe needs a housekeeper.\u201d He shot a glance at the doorway to make sure that the castellan was well and truly gone.\"\r\n\"\r\n\r\nA note worthy of mentioning, Khadgar was around seventeen of age when he became Medivh's apprentice, and judging by the Blizzard-set timeline, he must be-- 4 from Warcraft 3 to WoW, twenty-something from Warcraft I to Warcraft III...plus 3 years between Vanilla and Burning Crusade...plus 17 years since Khadgar was the Apprentice...\r\n\r\nI would judge he is in his mid-thirties, although his appearance begs to differ.", "date": "2009-02-01T09:48:57-06:00", "rating": 37, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[quote]I would judge he is in his mid-thirties, although his appearance begs to differ.[/quote] Makes sense, since Sargeras cast an irreversible spell on him, stealing his youth.", "creationdate": "2009-08-11T14:18:10-05:00", "id": 115395, "rating": 19, "commentid": 590746, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "236685", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "Also another funny quote (unless I missed it): So, what are you sorting the books by? \"Deadly and non-deadly.\"", "creationdate": "2012-02-25T22:45:24-06:00", "id": 522705, "rating": 8, "commentid": 590746, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "Sarach", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Khadgar pulls you aside, and offers a guided tour of the city by his servant.  The servant's text appears in your General text window.  \n\nSince the General window is the home of the General and Trade channel, the text can be swept away.  Also, it becomes easy to lose track of your place in the \"wall of text\".\n\nIf you're curious, or missed some of the speech, here's a transcript.\n\n[quote][b][u]Kadgar's Servant whispers:[/u][/b]\n\nShattrath was once the draenei capital of this world. Its name means \"dwelling of light.\"\n\nWhen the Burning Legion turned the orcs against the draenei, the fiercest battle was fought here. The draenei fought tooth and nail, but in the end the city fell.\n\nThe city was left in ruins and darkness... until the Sha'tar arrived.\n\nLet us go into the Lower City.  I will warn you that as one of the only safe havens in Outland, Shattrath has attracted droves of refugees from all wars, current and past.\n\nThe Sha'tar, or \"born from light\" are the naaru that came to Outland to fight the demons of the Burning Legion.\n\nThey were drawn to the ruins of Shattrath City where a small remnant of the draenei priesthood conducted its rites inside a ruined temple on this very spot.\n\nThe priesthood, known as the Aldor, quickly regained its strength as word spread that the naaru had returned and reconstruction soon began.  The ruined temple is now used as an infirmary for injured refugees.\n\nIt wouldn't be long, however, before the city came under attack once again.  This time, the attack came from Illidan's armies. A large regiment of blood elves had been sent by Illidan's ally, Kael'thas Sunstrider, to lay waste to the city.\n\nAs the regiment of blood elves crossed this very bridge, the Aldor's exarchs and vindicators lined up to defend the Terrace of Light.  But then the unexpected happened.\n\nThe blood elves laid down their weapons in front of the city's defenders; their leader, a blood elf elder known as Voren'thal, stormed into the Terrace of Light and demanded to speak to A'dal.\n\nAs the naaru approached him, Voren'thal kneeled before him and uttered the following words: \"I've seen you in a vision, naaru. My race's only hope for survival lies with you. My followers and I are here to serve you.\"\n\nThe defection of Voren'thal and his followers was the largest loss ever incurred by Kael's forces. And these weren't just any blood elves.  Many of the best and brightest amongst Kael's scholars and magisters had been swayed by Voren'thal's influence.\n\nThe naaru accepted the defectors, who would be known as the Scryers; their dwelling lies in the platform above.  Only those initiated with the Scryers are allowed there.\n\nThe Aldor are followers of the Light and forgiveness and redemption are values they understand. However, they found hard to forget the deeds of the blood elves while under Kael's command.\n\nMany of the priesthood had been slain by the same magisters who now vowed to serve the naaru.  They were not happy to share the city with their former enemies.\n\nThe Aldor's most holy temple and its surrounding dwellings lie on the terrace above.  As a holy site, only the initiated are welcome inside.\n\nThe attacks against Shattrath continued, but the city did not fall, as you can see. On the contrary, the naaru known as Xi'ri led a successful incursion into Shadowmoon Valley - Illidan's doorstep.\n\nThere he continues to wage war on Illidan with the assistance of the Aldor and the Scryers.  The two factions have not given up on their old feuds, though.\n\nSuch is their animosity that they vie for the honor of being sent to assist the naaru there. Each day, that decision is made here by A'dal.  The armies gather here to receive A'dal's blessing before heading to Shadowmoon.\n\nKhadgar should be ready to see you again.  Just remember that to serve the Sha'tar you will most likely have to ally with the Aldor or the Scryers.

Despite his good manners, staying quiet and a few feet away at most times, he is currently overstaying his welcome. While we\u2019re working with our resident exorcists to gently banish him back to his original plane of existence there is a possible workaround that may resolve the issue in the meantime.\n\nIf you visit the Archivist Elysiana in the Violet Citadel in the Broken Isle version of Dalaran she'll allow you to return to complete the pre-launch quests. By doing those, that should allow Khadgar's Upgraded Servant to offer the quest you are eligible for and allow it to vanish now that it has performed it's duty.  We understand that this is less than ideal but it will allow him to continue on his journey and you on yours for the time being.\n\nWe appreciate your patience while we work the \u2018Bugs\u2019 out of this ritual. If you encounter any other in-game bugs you can report them using the following steps: \n\n- Click Help to open the Customer Support window.\n- Click Submit Bug.\n- Enter the details of the bug, making sure to follow the guidelines outlined on the submission form.\n- Click Submit.\n\nYou can also report and find other ongoing bugs on our forums:\nBug Report Forum: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1012660/\n\nThank you for your contact and we hope you continue to enjoy Legion!\u200b\u200b\u200b\"\n\nEdit: Update as of Sept. 12 2016, I JUST did this method and it WORKED!
