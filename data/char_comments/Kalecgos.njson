The difference is that the raid may no longer stand right in front of his platform while doing it. To despawn him successfully, everyone must first move back into the [b]small circular room right before the path to his platform[/b].\n\nWhen you engage him from this position, he will not be able to fit through the small door once he reaches the raid, resulting in a despawn. Of course, your window of opportunity to resurrect does get smaller, since your healers now have to run the full path from the small room to the platform instead of taking two steps like before. \n\nIn addition to spell haste gear, it helps to have the healers mounted, with Crusader Aura, hovering over their run keys and ready to run in as soon as the despawn is complete. All in all, it is still quite doable as long as you are on your game (which you should be anyway, if you are attempting Sunwell).\n\n\nAnother thing to note is that Kalecgos seems to pick a [b]particular raid member[/b], and lock on to [b]that[/b] target every single time once your Eye of Kilrogg dies (or your rogue vanishes, your hunter feign's death, whatever other engage method you use to despawn him...).\n\nThis means that there is no way around having the whole raid move back during the first despawn, however once you find out which target he locks on to, [b]only that person needs to stay in that small room[/b], while your rezzers may all move back to their pre-2.4.2 position.\n\nAs long as [b]none of them cast any spells[/b] while Kalecgos is being despawned, he will run right past them on his way to the threat target that he is locked to.\n\nHope this saves a couple of raids from re-clearing trash, and good luck!", "date": "2008-05-13T23:44:02-05:00", "rating": 4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for clearing that up :) We killed him fast this week, didn't have time to mess with it >.>  Updated comment!", "creationdate": "2008-05-15T06:32:05-05:00", "id": 335267, "rating": 0, "commentid": 287702, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "148317", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "We had our first wipe night, and did this succesfully three times:  Enhance Shaman with instant Ghost Wolf fires a lightning bolt at max range, turns and runs like hell in ghost wolf.

Took us about 5 attempts to get it figured out and execute it properly.\r\n\r\nOn the pull, the bear put up only Lacerate and FF then continued to refresh Lacerate and do only auto-attacks. I auto-attacked until I had a full rage bar then waited to be ported into the other realm. Inside, I used Deathwish (but not Recklessness) and burned through as much of Sathrovarr's health as possible, using Enraged Regeneration when I hit ~40% hp.\r\n\r\nOnce I was inside, the Bear started a full tanking rotation to burn as much of Kalec's HP as possible. When I was ported out, Sathrovarr had about 45-50% of his HP remaining.\r\n\r\nOnce I ported out, the Bear removed my curse, I waited for the next application of Arcane Buffet, then immediately started to bandage. I then proceeded to do a limited dps rotation, basically just Bloodthirst for the healing. \r\n\r\nWhen 5 seconds remained on my Spectral Exhaustion, I switched to def stance, equipped a shield and taunted the boss. The bear put up 3 stacks of Lifebloom on me, along with a Rejuv and was then ported into the spectral realm. I kept going with just Bloodthirst, Demo shout and Thunderclap.\r\n\r\nInside, the Druid went kitty to put up some bleeds on Sathrovarr, then went back to bear and attempted to DPS him down as far as possible, also having to make use of Frenzied Regneration.\r\n\r\nWhen the bear returned to the real world, she healed herself up and bandaged, tossed me a few HoTs, then took the boss back from me. I still had ~80k hp left at this point, not having used my Enraged Regen a second time (that was where I had went wrong on an earlier attempt, wasting my regen on Kalec instead of using it for Sathrovarr and ending up dead). \r\n\r\nI reentered the spectral realm with Sathrovarr on about 25% hp and quickly nuked him down with Deathwish again, once more having to make use of my Enraged Regeneration. He dropped dead with about 30 seconds remaining in the spectral realm, but it really made no difference. Kalec's enrage was very easily handled by the Bear and she was still on 95% HP when I finally returned to the real world. The last 10% of Kalec's hp disappeared quickly and easily.", "date": "2011-07-28T09:58:34-05:00", "rating": 4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
