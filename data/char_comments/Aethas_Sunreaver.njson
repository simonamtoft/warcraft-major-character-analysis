{"commentv2": 1, "number": 61, "id": 2538057, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Zharaella", "body": "For those who like to follow wow lore or just curious like I was about who Aethas Sunreaver is/was, I did a bit of research and concluded that Aethas is not a resurrected Kael'thas Sunstrider. Even though there are similarities. \r\n\r\nBoth were members of the Kirin Tor. Kael'thas Sunstrider abandoned his membership to pursue other methods to save his people from the deprivations of magic withdrawal after the destruction of the Sunwell. At the time of his membership Jaina was a teenage apprentice and Kael fell in love with her but Jaina only had eyes for Arthas Menethil (why would she want a highelf, not even the same species). Aethas Sunreaver became a member of the Kirin Tor some time after this as he and his Sunreavers aided in the fight against the Lich King, he helped Jaina (no longer an apprentice) acquire leadership of the Kirin Tor but was later ousted by Jaina when she believed that his Sunreavers had helped steal the Divine bell from Darnassus.\r\n\r\nThe matter of death and all things undead. Kael'thas is most likely dead, dead as dead can get. After being defeated in Tempest Keep, emphasis on 'defeated', he makes a reappearance in Magister's Terrace. After a successful Tempest Keep, back in Shattrath City when Ad'al's thought invade your mind etc etc. Kael'thas yells ... your monkeys failed to finish the job, Naaru! Beaten but alive... (he mocks those who came for mere trinkets but left without finishing him off). So, still alive but very sickly and with not so many firey orbs he reappears in Magister's Terrace where he is finally killed, I'm pretty sure a severed head means dead. Aethas Sunreaver on the other hand has had no deaths on record. Jaina imprisoned him in the Violet Hold where he was rescued by Rommath and fled back to Silvermoon, then under the command of Lor'themar he reappears on Isle of Thunder in Pandaria along with his Sunreavers. Aethas being uncomfortable at the sight of Jaina is likely a reference to her having removed him from his position in the Kirin Tor and imprisoning him for his supposed involvement with the Divine Bell theft. Wounded pride? Embarassment? who knows, maybe he secretly wants to smash her in her pretty face. I would.\r\n\r\nFelo'melorn - the weapon of choice. Once belonging to Dath'remar Sunstrider it was a family heirloom of the Sunstrider line but was broken. Kael'thas finds felo'melorn and reforges it with 'magic, hatred and a burning need of revenge'. Now a fire mage's dream weapon Kael uses it to Battle the Lich King (the original one - Ner'zul) along side his rival for Jaina's affection Arthas and his new buddy Illidan. Long story short - Arthas betrays everything he loves for vengeance. Kael clashes with Arthas, however, he fails against Frostmorne and falls back. Illidan then clashes with Arthas and is grievously wounded. Kael & Vashj take a beaten and bloody Illidan back to Outland and nothing more is seen of Felo'melorn. It was assumed Kael took it with him when he fled to Outland, however, it does not appear on loot tables from Tempest Keep or Magister's Terrace so it can also be assumed that he lost his precious blade in Icecrown.\r\n\r\nSo, many years later Aethas Sunreaver knows the whereabouts of Felo'melorn. This might seem suspicious but remember he was a mage (they are in love with all things magical), he was an active member of the Kirin'Tor, participated in and knew many of the bloody and sordid details of the conflict in Icecrown against Arthas/Lich King, he knew Jaina personally and professionally, is a blood elf and has a vested interest in saving face in light of Kael'thas' history and betrayal. \r\nHis only interest in recovering Felo'melorn seems only to get him reinstated with the Kirin Tor or at least being allowed back in Dalaran. If he felt he had any claim to it (if he was Kael'thas Sunstrider in disguise he most certainly would) he shows no sign of it, so he leaves this most desired fire mage weapon of choice in MY capable hands.\r\n\r\nLyandra Sunstrider. Who is she? So much in a name... Sunstrider. Not much is known of her but she is clearly a relative/descendant of the Sunstrider line. Lyandra is a mage and apparently goes in search of Felo'melorn, after all it's not just the ultimate fire mage toy it is her birthright too. Lyandra's hunt for Felo'melorn gets her heart's desire but at a cost. She gets to wield her family heirloom but she becomes an undead under the Lich Kings control in the process. I guess dreams do come true.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion and of course my opinion (feel free to disagree) Aethas Sunreaver is an all round good guy caught up in a world of turmoil and grief and looking for a place to call home and a purpose in life (as much as a Warcraft npc has one). Although he seems to prefer to hide his face and wear a seriously outdated transmog set he seems legit and has no significant connection to Kael'thas Sunstrider apart from a name similarity. He could have bad acne scaring but that's no reason to assume he has anything to do with a crazy high-elf who wants his master Kil'jaeden to grant him power and consume all.\r\n\r\nThen there's me. A new chapter in the History of Felo'melorn. I probably have more in common with Lyandra than Kael'thas does to Aethas. My quest to get my weapon of choice also takes me to Icecrown. I face the Lich King and am challenged to be a better mage than the one who wields it. I destroy Lyandra in my quest to acquire it. Lyandra Sunstrider had a more legitimate claim to it than I but since I have proven to be more ruthless, depraved and desperate it is now MINE. Plus I am undead, ha... the irony.", "date": "2017-11-30T19:03:41-06:00", "rating": 1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
