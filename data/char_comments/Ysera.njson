You will need to jump between the roots of the tree. 1 jump is very important ( i had to use [spell=1706] ) preper any skill that can take you a short distance in the air. You will need to jump [b]18.1 62.0[/b] on a tree root. If you miss you are dead xD. Get on root and go up to [b]broken cart 19.8 63.4[/b] [item=181243] is under a seat.\r\n\r\n[b]Step 2:[/b]\r\n[b]You need to get [npc=165704] to Glitterfall Basin.[/b] She will do for You [item=181242]. You will need to have [item=181243] + 10 [item=173204] [b]You need to be dismounted[/b] when you will ask her to create [item=181242]. \r\n\r\nFly to Glitterfall Basin and go to [b]50.4 33.1[/b] if [npc=165704][b] is there you can skip Step 2 if not You need to do 2 Storylines  xD:[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Quests to do, in order:[/b]\r\n\r\n1st Storyline start from [npc=158345] 51.1 33.8\r\n[storyline=1162]:\r\n1.

To defeat him you need a [item=178675].\n\n1. You must first go to [i]Tirna Scithe[/i], in the far west. To do this, it's best to fly to [i]Root-home[/i] and then ride south. At [i]Darkreach[/i], turn right and then keep left. At [i]Tirna Scithe[/i], keep northwest, passing the world boss [npc=167527] on the right if active.\n - At about 18.1, 62.1 jump onto the root, or use [spell=300728] or similar. Then follow the root up until you reach a cart. Grab the [item=181243] which is lying on the ground.\n\n2. Now go to the [i]Glitterfall Basin[/i]. Take 10x [item=173204] with you.\n- If you don't see [npc=165704] at 50.4, 33.0, you need to complete two questlines first. [storyline=1162] and [storyline=1163], see also here: [achievement=14800]\n- If you see [npc=165704], speak to them and you will get an [item=181242]. [b]Attention:[/b] Get off your mount first!\n\n3. Now make your way to [npc=160262] in the [i]Heart of the Forest[/i]. Should you not get into the building, speak to one of the [npc=165997] in front of it. Talk to [npc=160262] at 47.7, 53.7 and you will get a [item=178675] from her. [b]Caution:[/b] Get off your mount first!\n\n4. As a final step, fly to the [i]Hibernal Hollow[/i] and take the exit to the north. When you are in the [i]Dreamshrine Basin[/i] use your [item=178675] and you will get the buff [spell=327083] which lasts for five minutes. During this phase you can see [npc=168135]. It's best to wait until he passes by. It will be difficult to defeat him alone. He uses [spell=341107], [spell=341116] and [spell=341106].\n\nCongratulations to your new mount. :-)\n\nI show you the steps to the mount in this [url=https://youtu.be/8U2BvbS5H5A]Video[/url]: https://youtu.be/8U2BvbS5H5A", "date": "2020-12-21T00:40:36-06:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 256, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2021-01-03T19:57:37-06:00", 1, "Tig3rE"]}

However, before they departed, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over Kalimdor, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. In that age, there were many dragonflights. Yet there were five flights that held dominion over their brethren. It was these five flights that the Titans chose to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the Pantheon imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights\u2019 leaders. These majestic dragons (as listed below) became known as the Great Aspects, or the Dragon Aspects.\nAman\u2019Thul, the Highfather of the Pantheon, bestowed a portion of his cosmic power upon the massive bronze dragon, Nozdormu. The Highfather empowered Nozdormu to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. The stoic, honorable Nozdormu became known as the Timeless One.\nEonar, the Titan patron of all life, gave a portion of her power to the red leviathan, Alexstrasza. Ever after, Alexstrasza would be known as the Life-Binder, and she would work to safeguard all living creatures within the world. Due to her supreme wisdom and limitless compassion for all living things, Alexstrasza was crowned the Dragonqueen and given dominion over her kind.\nEonar also blessed Alexstrasza\u2019s younger sister, the lithe green dragon Ysera, with a portion of nature\u2019s influence. Ysera fell into an eternal trance, bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Known as the Dreamer, she would watch over the growing wilds of the world from her verdant realm, the Emerald Dream.\nNorgannon, the Titan lore keeper and master-magician, granted the blue dragon, Malygos, a portion of his vast power. From then on, Malygos would be known as the Spell-Weaver, the guardian of magic and hidden arcanum.\nKhaz\u2019goroth, the Titan shaper and forger of the world, bestowed some of his vast power upon the mighty black wyrm, Neltharion. The great-hearted Neltharion, known afterwards as the Earth-Warder, was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of the world and served as Alexstrasza\u2019s greatest supporter.\nThus empowered, the Five Aspects were charged with the world\u2019s defense in the Titans\u2019 absence. With the dragons prepared to safeguard their creation, the Titans left Azeroth behind forever. Unfortunately it was only a matter of time before Sargeras learned of the newborn world\u2019s existence\u2026.\n\n[b][i]As you can see these are the Titans:[/i][/b]\n-[i]Aman'Thul[/i] (The High Father of the Pantheon) *Blessed Nozdormu*\n-[i]Eonar[/i] (The Titan Patron of all Life) *Blessed Alexstrasza and Ysera*\n-[i]Norgannon[/i] (The Titan lore-keeper and Master Magician) *Blessed Malygos*\n-[i]Khaz'goroth[/i] (The Titan shaper and forger of the world) *Blessed Neltharion* A.K.A Deathwing\n-Sargeras ( Didnt blessed anyone ) and he became corrupt *Not sure if he was a servant or Titan*\n\nDragon Aspects:\n -Alexstrasza the Life-Binder\n -Ysera the Dreamer\n -Nozdormu the Timeless One\n -Neltharion the Earth Warder (AkA Deathwing the Destroyer)\n -Malygos the Spell-Weaver", "date": "2011-09-15T18:52:43-05:00", "rating": 7, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-09-16T20:18:43-05:00", 4, "Arraya"]}

She will be receiving druid like armor with a Night Elven skin on a Blood/High Elven body much like Alexstrasza and Sylvanas Windrunner.\n\nAccording to MMO Champion and Wowwiki, Ysera will play a major role in aiding the Red Dragonflight against Deathwing the Destroyer and his Dark Flight. This is to be expected due to the fact that Alexstrasza and Ysera are close sisters.\n\n\nI have not see any information on what will happen to the Malygos-less Blue Dragonflight. Nor have I seen any information on Nozdormu and his supposed-ed leadership of the Infinite Dragonflight. It is un-released, or just not seen by me, whether they will aid in the fall of the Black Dragonflight and their twisted Lord.\n\nI believe that the Blue Dragonflight will either aid when and where they can, or they will leave the war to their once hated enemies that had turned against Malygos in his plan to destroy all magic users. \nThe Bronze Dragonflight, however, is not yet shown to have any ill feelings towards any of the Flights. (Except the Blackflight, with good reasoning of course.)\n\n\n\n\nThis is all making me wonder, what has caused Ysera to leave her verdant realm? She has left her flight to deal with the Emerald Nightmare alone. Has the Green Dragonflight finally won the Emerald War? Or has Ysera given up on her own flight/realm in order to answer the call of her sister and all of Azeroth?  Only the Cataclysm will tell us what lies ahead for all the Dragons and mortals of Azeroth.........\n\n\nEdit:Because right after you post something, you see a mistake.\n\nEdit 2: As battm7 said, Ysera has left her realm due to the fact that the Emerald Nightmare has been defeated.", "date": "2010-09-13T18:13:40-05:00", "rating": 17, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "The reason she left is that the Nightmare is defeated.", "creationdate": "2010-12-29T00:31:08-06:00", "id": 471242, "rating": 1, "commentid": 1120169, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "513901", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-01-11T21:21:58-06:00", 2, "Elarieline"]}
