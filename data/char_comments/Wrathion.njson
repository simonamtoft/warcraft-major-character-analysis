DO NOT FORGET.\"\r\n\r\nHaving read the World of Warcraft: Chronicle, this scene makes much more sense - in a particularly horrifying way.\r\n\r\nThe Pantheon attempted to directly intervene with Sargeras and his Burning Legion; Sargeras remained determined to continue his crusade and killed his protege and friend, Aggramar, leading to the conflict between his Legion and the Pantheon. Ultimately, Sargeras proved victorious, but before he could finish off his former brethren with a blast of fel magic, Norgannon cast a spell that would preserve the souls of the Pantheon. The blast destroyed their physical forms, but their spirits were sent hurtling through the abyss. They eventually found their way to Azeroth - which they had previously found to be housing a World Soul - essentially a Titan in its infant stages; one that could be more powerful than any other Titan previously discovered. They briefly possessed the Keepers, hoping to regain physical forms, but their power quickly dimmed.\r\n\r\nI believe what happens with Wrathion when he eats Let Shen's heart is similar to that event - he gains a glimpse at what the Titans had seen before their destruction, and delivers the message the Pantheon had brought to the Keepers long ago. The 'Final Titan'... is what Azeroth was supposed to become.\r\n\r\nKnowing that... Knowing the Pantheon is gone, that Azeroth is well and truly the best and last hope for the universe to stand against Sargeras, his Legion, and the Void Lords that Sargeras seeks to deprive of a universe to rule...
