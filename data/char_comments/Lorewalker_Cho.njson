If you are very lucky, you can nearly take out all of his pets with Infinite Whelpling alone by using Sleeping Gas. When it puts a target to sleep, the pet will swap out with another pet. If that one gets put to sleep, it will again swap out. Every time they swap, they lose their turn. If Sleeping Gas never puts them to sleep, its damage will have built up enough that you will kill Patience in approximately three or four attacks. Because Patience is a magic pet, you cannot hit for more than 35% of its health in a single attack. Sleeping Gas, having built up its damage, will hit very hard. This is also where Darkflame is useful, to diminish the healing it does to itself. You can use Healing Flame after being hit by [petability=456] to negate nearly all of its damage.\r\n\r\nScourged Whelpling is an excellent pet against Patience and Knowledge. Patience' attacks already have a low hit chance, so with Darkness up, you can escape a hit or two. His healing will be minimized as well. Because Scourged Whelpling is a slow pet (it doesn't matter which breed you have, though I run with H/H for the 22% health increase), Tail Sweep will always hit twice. Because its undead, you will easily be able to take out Knowledge, even if [petability=753] 'kills' you.
