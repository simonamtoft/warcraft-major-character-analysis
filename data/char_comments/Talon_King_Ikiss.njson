As soon as he starts to cast poly, the other rogue (who will not be poly'd) cast AR and burn. When he blinks, throw a few SS in but don't use your eviscerate. He will go immune to all damage shortly after his blink so you want to save the CP. Run behind the pillar and wait. During this time the druid should shift out and cast a HOT on himself. After the blink, start again, but this time, the rogue that was poly'd needs to go easy DPS. This will insure that the poly will go to the rogue who should be lower in health.
