Garrsoh on the other hand the moment he wen't though the portal his mind set on Conquering. He observed Thrall's meeting in Theramore, taking the opportunity to find weakness's, he became ruthless behind Thralls back, he spat at every chance at a peaceful meeting, be it to attempt world Peace between the Alliance and horde and mocked and soon engaged Varian Wrynn, causing a riot in Dalaran between the two factions when they needed aid in Ulduar. \nHe also spat at Tirion Fordring of all people, and mocked his way of preparing for the Assault on Icecrown which astonished Thrall.\n His presence also was also encouraging the Horde's more Brutal side, he enslaved Alliance in the Tundra, to threatening Saurfang who sensed the \"boy\" was Trouble. The moment Thrall decided to step down from Warcheif is when all Hell (Get it? \"Hell\"scream) Broke loose, Garrosh at first glance looked to be a great fit to the tittle, however it became apparent that things were getting out of hand.\n  Cairne and Voljin were one of the first few to notice this Lust of war, and the old tauarn decided to test young Hellscream by challenging him for the Title of Warcheif. Garrosh raised the stakes, with  fight to the death, thinking the Old Tauren would back off, but he excepted the challenge, however the Grimtotem found the perfect opportunity to strike out, and poisoned Hellscream's blade (he thinking it was a enchantment, foolish not to inspect or notice the Poisoned blade) Bloodhoof had the upper hand yet after a single cut was he crippled and Garrosh not noticing the weakened tauren ruthlessly killed him with out a not a notice. This enraged the tauren and soon the Grimtotem attacked an nearly took over Thunderbluff. Garrosh who at last realized it was a set up was outraged that he killed in dishonorable blood at lest attempted to make up for what he did.\n But this made the Tuaren distrustful of him, and soon it came to the trolls. Vol'jin noticed how he continued to become ruthless in the war, as Vol'jin was  gotten out of hand with bloodlust and soon he left threatening the Warchief that he would be their to kill him if he would ever betray the Horde, and departed with the Tribe to the Echo Isles. He (Garrosh) also disliked the Bloodelves, and was Displeased and with the Forsaken ways. (Which to any race would of had the same reaction any how, as the Banshee queen was looking more like the Lichking had now an days). The only ones that seem to respect Hellscream were the orcs and Goblins (who were in the war for profit).\n His war efforts were becoming reckless, doing much damage around him, he decimated his enemies, he started making the Horde more savage, blood thirsty, as he became power hungry. One of the few moments of good was when he was shocked when a Horde commander blew up a Town of innocent Druids, (which he soon used this event as a staging point later on in Theramore) But even that was't enough to be respected. \nWith Thrall out helping the shaman and Hero's fending off Deathwing, Garrosh grew in power,  nearly destroying Ashenvale of its forests for more then enough resources, the Goblins carved Azshara in his name (which in turn destroyed half of the land) and once the Horde found ,Pandaria a new land, Fit in his eyes for the taking. Nearly every Horde who was fueled with lust for Battle, the moment they stepped onto the shores is when it was corrupted. So much pride was in his Eyes that he and his Horde wen;'t out of control. And now he replaces out beloved Horde, with This \"New\" Horde, attempted to Kill Vol'jin and dug deep into the Beautiful lands, disrespecting the People, and doing much harm to the lands around him. \nHe attempted to use the Sha's power, he actually liked the Mogu's history of conquer, and enslavement and kept this in mind. Soon his Horde (The Goblins)  Found the object that could be his Key to world domination. The heart of a Old God of all things. His pride had Consumed his well being. No longer caring about the world about him, he only saw Conquering, and Bloodshed. And became like any other Villain before him. Dishonoring his Fathers name, even Tossing his own Blade aside for a more Powerful weapon. Using the Heart as a weapon, to his rule. Giving its power to twist and empower his New Horde. Made from Blackrock, Dragonmaw and Korkron orcs, among others. planing to even bring The orcs of Outland to join his army. It was as if he started another Orcs vs Human like age. Few of the original Horde remained at his side at this point. They seen enough of this conquest. \nEven the very Blade that his Father used to save his People was abused. Tossed aside, leaving what little good he had behind with it. Thrall himself was shocked and saddened by his friends tyranny, how he changed the Horde's image, how he destroyed the honor and culture that they worked so long to perfect. \nThrall knowing the this must be stopped as  accepted to help  aid this cause. It was he who took in the Broken Orc and attempted to show him the beauty  and culture of his people and the world around them. And now it has been decided, be it Horde or Alliance, Human or Troll they all agree. It is Time to Destroy this power hungry Tyrant. For the Son of Grom must be dethroned, Hellscream must die! For The Horde, for the Alliance!\n\n\"Sorry if this is so long. You can call me a lore Nerd if you want. I tried my best to explain as much as I could. If I missed any thing or might of done a few mistakes feel free to point them out. Thank you, an hope this information helps.\"\n\nEdit: \"I'm not really sure why this was down rated so badly.

Move from one to the other when the desecrate from the axe goes out and have ranged DoT them down. Staying grouped is very important, and should be done even in phases 2 and 3. \r\nKorkron Wolf Riders (shamans riding wolves) should be[b] first dps priority[/b].\r\nIf you have a knockback or AoE snare available, use it on the adds when the iron star comes out. It will not kill them from full health, so some AoE dps on them beforehand is necessary.\r\nYou can blow heroism/bloodlust/timewarp/Ancient Hysteria at the beginning of the fight; you'll have it back up for phase 3.\r\n\r\nIntermissions:\r\n You will get one of three zones: Temple of the Jade Serpent, Temple of the Red Crane  or Terrace of Eternal Spring. Jade Serpent temple has groups of 3 medium mobs, AoE down and rush boss. Terrace has a large number of small adds, simply charge through and pick them up as you go; they should be AoE'd down together before Garrosh. Stampeding Roar is very useful here, Aspect of the Pack not so much. Temple of the Red Crane has two split paths, with a big Sha at the end of the group. Split the raid evenly, and have the tanks lead - mark them beforehand if you need to, as the sha hit fairly hard.\r\nIn the intermission, Garrosh will spam Devastation (similar to Malkorok's cone attack), move out of the purple graphic on the ground.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: \r\nDesignate a raid marker for the healers and ranged to stack on when you teleport back. Handle desecrates as before (move from one marker to the other, DoT down the weapons)\r\nGarrosh's whirlwind attack will spawn small sha adds - while the buff they give each other upon dying is a real danger on higher difficulties, in LFR you can group them up and AoE them down without much problem.\r\nThe[b] REAL[/b] danger in this phase and the next is the mind controls (Touch of Y'Shaarj) that go out: LFR will have 3 MC's each time (any combination of melee+ranged), and DPS will absolutely need to be on the ball for interrupting the casts of Touch of Y'Shaarj that the mind controls will casts on other members - this will MC more people and wipe the raid if not stopped. Burn the mind controlled people down to 20% to bring them back.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 (DO NOT TUNNEL VISION!):\r\nGarrosh will get empowered by the Heart of Y'Shaarj and take on a Sha-infested appearance. The desecrated weapons can no longer be permanently killed, so it is VERY important that the ranged+healers stay stacked and move together to prevent covering the entire room in void zones, and can handle MCs quickly.\r\nThe adds spawned from whirlwind are beefier and hit harder - the offtank could try picking them up and holding them while DPS focus on boss and any MC raid members.\r\nMind Controls: People are now instead turned into Sha, and are no longer subject to loss of control effects (fears, stuns etc.) Interrupts still work, and their casts can and should be interrupted. Burn them down to 20% as before, they will just be beefier than in phase 2.\r\nYou should have Bloodlust/Heroism/Time Warp/Ancient Hysteria available again now, use it when boss is at ~15% or so. Try to time it immediately after MC'd people have been brought back so as to maximize dps.\r\nGood luck and have fun!", "date": "2013-10-26T12:08:00-05:00", "rating": 92, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "A note on the MCs.

[b]In addition to normal drops, Garrosh drops \"Essence of the Cursed _____\" tokens.[/b]* These can be traded in at your faction's shrine for [b]any[/b] tier token. Perfect for completing your 4P or starting an off-set! They drop from all difficulties, and will obviously give you tier appropriate for that difficulty. You can bonus roll them!\n*[i]Example token: [item=105857][/i]\n\n2. [b]In Heroic and Mythic difficulty, Garrosh has a [i]ridiculously miniscule chance[/i] to drop [item=103785][/b] (yes, it can be Warforged). Not only are these well itemized with [b]3[/b] red sockets, but they also use the model of Garrosh's iconic shoulders! We all know you want to transmog those.\n\n3. [b][item=104253] has a small drop chance on [i][u]Mythic[/u][/i] difficulty [i]only[/i][/b]. Prior to Warlords of Draenor, this mount was guaranteed to drop.\n\n[i][b][u]Heirloom Loot Info[/u][/b][/i]\nDuring Mists of Pandaria, Garrosh dropped Level 90-100 Heirloom Weapons that used the old Horde PvP models. These items are no longer obtainable, and thus all of the information below was retained for reference to a piece of WoW history.\n\n[s]1. [b]Heirloom weapons are personal loot regardless of difficulty[/b], however since Normal also uses personal loot, it is worth noting that the heirloom roll [b]is not[/b] the same as your loot roll. You can win both an item and an heirloom from the same kill.[/s]\n\n[s]2. [b]Heirloom weapons do not drop off of LFR.[/b] They only drop off of Normal, Heroic, and Mythic and have an appropriate iLevel based on where it dropped.[/s]\n\n3. (This bullet was heavily edited for clarity.) [b]You were not guaranteed an heirloom upon defeating Garrosh until 6.0[/b], at which point you had a 100% chance per difficulty, per character, for your first heirloom. With the release of Warlords of Draenor, the heirlooms were removed from his loot table.\n\n4a. [b]The heirloom weapons [u]cannot[/u] be upgraded[/b], however they are [b]16 iLevel higher[/b] than other items in the same difficulty, which is equal to a [b]4/4 item upgrade[/b].\n4b. [b]They cannot drop as \"Warforged\".[/b]\n\n[s]5a. [b]The first weapon that you win will be appropriate for your loot-specialization.[/b] If you are fortunate enough to win one of these, you will get a weapon relevant to you. (As an example, a hunter's first heirloom WILL be [item=105670].) Even if you have a better weapon already (such as a Heroic when a Normal item dropped), I recommend [b]keeping[/b] the heirloom, as it will outlast your current item as you level up. Not to mention, they can be used for transmogrification!\n5b. [b]After your first heirloom, you can win any other heirloom from his loot table regardless of class or loot specialization.[/b]\n5c. [b]The item for your spec is separate for all difficulties.[/b] Therefore, your first successful heirloom roll on Normal will grant an appropriate weapon, as it will in Heroic and Mythic. You do not need to avoid doing lower difficulties in fear that some invisible, malevolent force will steal your upgrades away.\n5d. [b]You can receive the same heirloom from the same difficulty in subsequent kills.[/b] Keep your fingers crossed that you get new ones![/s]\n\n[s]6. [b]You cannot receive Garrosh Heirlooms from Bonus Rolls.[/b] After much debate and conflicting information, [url=https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/427883052681793536]it has been confirmed[/url] that they cannot be coined.[/s]\n\n7.

Suggested raid composition for 10man: 2 tanks, 1-3 healers and 5-7 dps (at least 2 ranged dps).\r\n\r\nThree phases:\r\n  - phase 1: ends at 10%, boss heals to full\r\n  - transition phase in another zone\r\n  - phase 2: ends at 10%, boss heals to 25%\r\n  - phase 3: harder version of phase 2\r\n\r\nPhase 1: adds, more adds, and Iron Stars\r\n\r\n  - Garrosh throws Desecrate at random raiders not in melee range, turns into a Desecrated Weapon which spawns a voidzone whose size corresponds to its health.\r\n  - Garrosh casts Hellscream's Warsong, increasing adds' damage and HP by 150%\r\n  - add 1: Kor'kron Warbringer, spawn in 2 groups of 3, Hamstring the tank\r\n  - add 2: Farseer Wolf Rider, casts Chain Lightning and Chain Heal. Will increase cast speed each time interrupted, so only interrupt Chain Heal\r\n  - Siege Engineers spawn on both sides of room and spend 15 seconds to release Iron Stars which roll across the room, instagibbing stuff. The Iron Stars deal raid damage when they hit the wall. Kill 1 Engineer and try to knockback the adds into the other Iron Star's path. Can also DK mass grip onto a totem, monk statue etc.\r\n- tank boss in centre of room, ranged dps and healers move between two markers for Desecrated Weapons. Throw DoTs on the weapons, tanks pick up adds and AoE them, interrupt the Wolf Riders. Have 1 ranged dps (or e.g. disc priest) kill one of the Siege Engineers so half the room is safe, try to push the adds into the path of the single Iron Star you let through. Tanks will take heavy damage from adds after Warsong.\r\n- the fight will probably take more than 10 minutes, so use Heroism/Bloodlust on the pull.\r\n\r\nTransition phase: begins shortly after Garrosh reaches 10% for the first time, and occurs periodically throughout phase 2\r\n\r\n  - teleports the raid to one of three random zones (Temple of the Jade Serpent, Terrace of Endless Spring, Temple of the Red Crane)\r\n  - for Temple of the Red Crane, split raid into 2 groups with 1 tank in each to tank the large add\r\n  - for Jade Serpent, each tank picks up the groups on their side, kill them quickly\r\n  - for ToES have one tank pick up all adds, then aoe them at the end\r\n  - adds have a chance to drop a buff when killed, run over it to gain 50% damage reduction that lasts until the end of the transition\r\n  - race to Garrosh to stop him casting (kill all adds then attack him)\r\n  - avoid Garrosh's frontal cone Annihilate, heal through the raid-wide damage. Lots of movement, use minor cooldowns as necessary\r\n\r\nPhase 2: 4 abilities, no adds (at first), as he gains energy he empowers his abilities one at a time\r\n\r\n  - Whirling Corruption: channeled raid damage, lessens at range. 3 Whirling Corruptions between each transition (so assign healing/mitigation cooldowns as 3 minute cooldowns will be available for each cycle). Empowered [25 energy]: hurls 6 projectiles at random raid members, doing 8-yard aoe, and spawns an add. When the spawned add dies, it heals other nearby adds. Stack up and use cooldowns for unempowered version, spread out for empowered version and have everyone pick up a single add and kill it at least 10 yards away from other adds.\r\n  - Touch of Y'Shaarj: mind control on 2 players that breaks at 20% HP. MCd players will attempt to MC others (interruptible). Empowered [50]: MCd targets gain HP and are immune to cc. If this is not empowered then use stuns and fears on the targets, if empowered only silences and interrupts will work. Do not use huge nukes (e.g. Chaos Bolt) or powerful dots/debuffs.\r\n  - Desecrate: same as in phase 1, hurls void zone-spawning weapons which can be dpsd. Empowered [75]: weapons cannot be killed and regen HP. Empowered void zone still shrinks based on weapon HP. To deal with empowered version, everyone should move around the room and place the Desecrates close to each other. Should only be empowered in phase 3.\r\n  - Gripping Despair: stacking tank DoT. Tank switch at 3-4 stacks (this will also fall off during Whirling Corruption). Empowered [100]: deals 15k raid damage per stack when it falls off, also debuffs raid when stacks fall off, increasing damage taken from explosion by 10% per stack - soft enrage. Should only be empowered in phase 3.\r\n  - transition phase will continue to occur every ~2.5 minutes\r\n  - ranged positioning can be similar to phase 1, if you decide to kill weapons\r\n  - don't kill adds near each other (each ranged dps can take one and split them), interrupt and nuke MCd players. Use defensives and rotate healing cooldowns during Whirling Corruption\r\n\r\nPhase 3: sh*t gets serious\r\n\r\n  - same as phase 2, but Garrosh always uses Empowered versions of his abilities\r\n  - raid must spread to deal with Whirling Corruption and the resulting adds, which need to be killed 1 at a time\r\n  - AoE interrupts/silences (Solar Beam, Ring of Peace, Blood Elf racial) are very strong\r\n  - recast Bloodlust/Heroism if you used it on the pull, as Sated will probably wear off during this phase\r\n  - consider having the boss tank pick up the first lot of adds and doing a single tank swap, then burning the boss. The add tank will pick up all future adds and tank them away from the boss, and none of the adds are killed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are a lot of ways to adjust raid composition (1-3 healers, Paragon use a single Holy Priest for 10man heroic), deal with siege engineers and adds, and adjust positioning/movement (especially during phase 3). Iterate until you find what works.\r\nThings likely to cause wipes:\r\n- Iron Stars: coordinate killing Siege Engineer(s) and don't stand in front of the giant wheel of death\r\n- adds in phase 1: use tank defensives after Warsong, use stuns, interrupt only Chain Heal and sort out interrupt order if required\r\n- excessive damage during Whirling Corruption and Annihilate: rotate healing and defensive cooldowns\r\n- everyone is mind controlled and is now fighting for Garrosh: spec into stuns and silences/interrupts. Sort out an interrupt order if required, and work on positioning to ensure someone can be close to the MCd targets\r\n- the adds from Empowered Whirling Corruption are killing everyone: spread out, use crowd control, ensure that they are never killed within 10 yards of another add. Consider having a tank pick them up and either taunt them one at a time (c.f. Nazgrim trash) or just ignore them and burn the boss\r\n- Garrosh hits really hard: tank/healer gear and rotation check, and re-examine off-tank role", "date": "2013-11-11T21:17:12-06:00", "rating": 41, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

We've brought our people security in Kalimdor, an end to the blockade, and an end to the total war that's split so much blood on either side of the great sea. \r\n\r\nNow, to the work of winning the peace. I would like to station a garrison near Theramore. We need to investigate cleansing the plague from Gilnean lands so they can rebuild.

How many more Alliance will number among the dead if we invaded Thunder Bluff, Azshara, and the Echo Isles? And how would we govern the conquered people?\r\n\r\nThe Pandaren always question why we fight.

I am willing to allow the Horde the use of Azshara's lumber if they abandon Ashenvale for good. Knowing the way that goblins chew through resources, we will see how long that will sustain them.\r\n\r\nI support this peace, but I do not share the High King's confidence.

Aggro an [npc=73415] and have it follow you into Garrosh's room, dragging it all the way to his throne.  Kill the ooze on top of him, and the resulting explosion will cause him to glitch, say his wipe dialogue, and despawn.  He'll respawn a few seconds later and you can attack him as normal, saving at least a minute and a half of waiting.  Even funnier is that Thrall will just stand in the middle of the room while you fight, absolutely clueless.\r\n\r\nI can't take credit for discovering this, it was brought to my attention by someone I was running with a while back.

His view of the horde as an unstoppable war-machine clashes violently with Thrall's pacifist views, and for a long time Garrosh time and time again challenged Thrall, to take a more active position regarding the alliance.\r\n\r\nstarting in patch 4.0, Garrosh will be the defacto leader of both the orcs, and the horde, serving as an acting Warchief in the place of Thrall.\r\n\r\n[s]the exact details are unknown ATM, but this post will be updated as the info becomes avaliable.[/s]\r\n\r\nEdit: New info is avaliable.

As this is going to be a long, tiresome endeavour Thrall has taken the necesary steps to ensure his people is well cared for in his absence, and named the most unlikely candidate to be Acting Warchief on his behalf while he saves the world from the upcoming elemental upheaval.\r\n\r\nWether Garrosh was a wise choise or rather he'll bring to ruin what took 2 decades for thrall to build.......... only time will tell.\r\n\r\nThis post will be updated as the expantion continues, to Chronicle Garrosh's actions (both the good and the bad) during the cataclysm.\r\n\r\nGarrosh shows up in the Silverpine forest during the quest \"the Warchief Cometh\" where he bears witness to Sylvannas' plan for the forsaken \"procreation\" (using Val'kyrs to raise recently dead humans as forsaken undead) and expresses heavy disaproval for it, going so far as to call Sylvannas a \"Bitch\" and notes that while everyone must face judgement before their maker some day, Sylvannas' may do so sooner than she expects. Curiously, even when Sylvannas clearly disobeyed his direct orders to never produce or deploy blight (lots of blight were deployed on Gilneas, and most of silverpine has multiple blight tanks) he doesn't reprimends her for it, nor does he even makes mention of this.\r\n\r\nWheter he actually changed his opinion of the blight and now sanctions its use, or he just was more shocked for the val'kyrs that he forgot to mention it, is yet to be determined.", "date": "2010-06-30T20:35:00-05:00", "rating": 76, "indent": 0, "roles": 264, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[b]HEAR ME![/b] [i]Do NOT defend him[/i]!

When Thrall showed him his father's act of heroism, his self opinion grew very high.\r\n                     Garrosh in Wrath of the Lich King\r\n He became very aggresive, and clashed with Thrall's pacifist views. He was interested very much in fighting the Alliance during the Warsong Offensive.\r\n                           Garrosh in Cataclysm\r\n Because of him being the son of Grom, and his war hero status, Thrall apointed him leader of the Horde, as Thrall knew he could benefit all of Azeroth in the Earthen Ring. Since then Garrosh has slain Cairne Bloodhoof in an unjust duel due to to Magatha's poison, insulted Sylvanas by calling her no different then the Lich King, and driven away Vol'Jin. He has clearly made himself enemies in his fellow leaders, and several amongst the Horde are against him. Many players have a hatred for him, and many wish Thrall was back. Garrosh is growing as a leader though, and during the final quest in the Kor'Kron chain he learns much of mercy from Chieftain Cliffwalker, and speaks of honor.\r\n                              My opinion of Garrosh\r\nI think that Garrosh is no Thrall, and that he is too warlike. I like fightig Alliance, but I need a slight moral. I dissaprove of Garros's aggresive pesonality, and wonder why Blizzard would put in such a jerk. Lately I have discovered that Garrosh is getting better, and that eventually he might become a great leader, but for now I hope he gets killed by an Alliance raid. People would die for Thrall, no matter the level, but I think you will see more people watching him die than helping him. \r\nP.S.

As the very earth beneath my feet started rumbling and getting torn apart, I had to come back.\nBut I'm confused now. Something went wrong here. The great Thrall is missing, the City is turned inside out. And this... Hellscream is the acting warchief?\nI've heard that it was Thrall's choice, and I do not question his wisdom, but... I fear the worst. The horde itself may be falling apart.\nMaster Vol'jin, first counselor and years-long aidee for the Warchief, wasn't he an obvious choice as a steward? Even the Dark Lady showed great talent in building and maintaining a whole society.\nWho was Cairne Bloodhoof, I may ask - some dumb cow? Every time I visited Thunder Buff, I felt it necessary to see him and kneel and bow before him, as a sign of respect for his wisdom and merits in battle. And even his untimely and unfair death is not enough for Thrall to admit at last, that for once, he made a bad choice? The peoples of the horde, and their leaders all hate Hellscream, as he stabbed even the Taurens, with whom the orcs were like brothers for a generation, right in the heart... \nI'm worried about Thrall. He was The Warchief for times I've seen, but now is somehow... seemingly losing it. Is there something I do not know about him, that weakens or stirs his mind?\nWhen you have to smash an enemy using your forces, like the hammer smashes the glowing yellow steel when forging a sword, then Hellscream is a good choice - that is what he is, a warrior from the head to the toe. Desperate times require desperate measures, and a stubborn, strict and hard-handed leader can be the tool for them. Make Garrosh Hellscream the supreme commander of the army, but not the warchief, for Thrall's sake... He's a warrior, not a politician!\nI'm worried about the Horde. Thrall's person used to be the Horde itself, and without him, cursed with an incompetent leader, it may be in grave danger.\nThe City could not comfort me anymore.

Horde and Alliance were just a failure in Icecrown.... I spit on em both, they just held back the Ashen Verdict. About the Sylvanas thing... I never actually liked her that much... but he was right back then, they sought to defeat the Lich King and Sylvanas is now nothing more and a mere copy of him. After what he did with Cairne... no comment. That wasn't \"honorable\", also he flee... making me think that he doesn't really believe in his quote \"Live your life this way: Lok'Tar Ogar!

Yet again Garrosh is getting humiliated... for needing Alliance to clean his #$%^ (Anduin Wyrnn and Lady Jaina Proudmoore together with Gazlowe helped Baine to take Thunder Bluff back), the so hated Alliance, also from what I have read... he looked kinda scared... not only that he needed Eitrigg to clear his mind... but even after doing so he didn't HELP, he stayed back and watched and then sent Magatha into the wilderness... such a cruel fate for a Tauren... which always loved nature and had great respect for \"The works of the Earthmother...\" Garrosh is nothing more than a mongrel... anyway that's my opinion, but he`s not A WAR HERO! Neither the Alliance NOR the Horde did $%^& in Icecrown... so the whole reason he got the rank of Warchief is just dust in the wind.... The Horde needs us now like never before... Alliance gets Malfurion back, we lose a mighty leader... charismatic and brave... as you used to say my friend... \"May the Earthmother smile upon you!\", also our dearest Warchief goes and leaves some non experienced and controversial \"war hero\" as the leader. This is the time when the Horde needs us most... so as for now I can only say \"Lok'Tar Ogar!

Or, because he is wearing Mannoroth's tusks and wielding Hellscreams Axe.\nI personally think that he is a good Horde leader. But he has the blood curse in his genes.\nHe will end up killing someone so important that everyone wants him dead. Although you might state that this is already the case, as he helped killing Cairne.\nRumors are going that he will be corrupted by N'zoth. I doubt this. I think that Mannoroth's Spirit will gain control over him. As mannoroth stated:\n\n\"So predictable... I knew you would come... and I see you brought the mighty Hellscream... his blood, is mine...\"\n\nHis blood is mine (Grom Hellscream, Thus also his son). And Mannoroth's bones are Hellscream's armor and Throne. So what i am saying is. Maybe there is a way that a demonic Pit Lord's spirit can survive. Although i doubt it.\nFor the rest, he has a rivalry with Varok Saurfang, veteran of the Horde. Who is a legendary character that is well known for being the best cleaver. ever.\n\n Cleave\u2014 Inflicts weapon damage plus 53.000.000 to an enemy and its nearest allies, affecting up to 10 targets.\n\nVarok was once much like hellscream, but has turned against these heartless tactics. Here is something that i read about him:\n\"He will not shy away from war, or hesitate to defend his people and the Horde. However, he refuses to start a war, and if it is within his power, \nhe will prevent a ->warmongering spirit<- from doing so. Whether through actions or by words, he will stop them anyway he can... no matter what.\"\n\nBut as to who Hellscream might kill in his blinded rage. I don't know. But it must be someone so important that it will turn me against my warchief.\nI will have Saurfang's back nonetheless. For he has served in every war, plus killed his already dead son. Tonight we feast in hell! But we eat gazelle instead of pork!\n\nGarrosh is already hated by every faction leader, Vol'jin of the Darkspear Tribe absolutely despises him stating that he abuses his status. \nHe labels Orcs and Taurens true horde, and thus evicted everyone else from Orgrimmar. Although he sees use in every member of the Horde, this move wasn't very smart.\n\nCONCLUSION: My favorite Warchief ever. He hates the Alliance, WHICH IS NORMAL FOR A WARCHIEF OF THE HORDE. He reinforced Orgrimmar, and gained more territory than any other warchief.\nSure he might be constantly buffed with bloodlust, and spamming Whirlwind on any messenger that brings him bad news. But isn't that part of being member of the Horde? Being Ruthless?\nAt least he isn't stupid, his Keep is right at the main plaza of Orgrimmar. Thus uniting him with Hero's that he deems Pure Horde.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWill my account see the days of me killing the Son of Hellscream? \n..... That chance is about the same as the chance that i will roll a Night Elf Hunter or a Gnome Rogue.\n0%, unless he kills Saurfang. Which i think he will.

Each victory bolsters the morale of the Horde forces here, which carries through to the rest of Azeroth.\n\nIt is unfortunate, then, that Hellscream employs such savage tactics.

There is supposed to be similar tension between followers of Varian Wrynn and those of Jaina Proudmoore, who see her as the real leader of the Alliance.  Perhaps we could see a civil war within both factions...and maybe a third faction emerging, one led jointly by Thrall and Jaina made up of those who are tired of the Alliance/Horde conflict and want to concentrate on taking on their real enemies, as opposed to Wrynn and Hellscream who are intent on fomenting a Fourth War regardless of the consequences?  Just a thought.  EDIT: The rumors around the Cataclysm expansion at this time follow what I said earlier, with Thrall handing over control of the Horde to Garrosh (who promptly declares open war on the Alliance) [s]and then being named the new Guardian of Tirisfal by the recently-returned Malfurion Stormrage[/s].  He then serves as the leader of the combined Alliance-Horde assault against Deathwing, much as Tirion Fordring does in the assault against the Lich King as head of the Argent Crusade.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nAs of 3.2.0, the argument between Thrall and Garrosh continues.  They arrive at the Argent Tournament grounds and wind their way to just in front of the flight master, where the following exchange ensues (this and the following event are on a timer of approximately 45 minutes):\r\n\r\n[b]Thrall says:[/b] I expect you to control yourself here.  I do not want a repeat of the Violet Citadel.\r\n\r\n[b]Garrosh Hellscream says:[/b] Pah!  That was a show of strength, worthy of a leader.  I only regret I did not kill that human before the mage interfered.\r\n\r\n[b]Thrall says:[/b] We are guests here, Garrosh, and you will conduct yourself honorably.\r\n\r\n[b]Garrosh Hellscream says:[/b] What honor is there in thrashing about with blunted sticks?  This is a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Thrall and Garrosh then continue walking to the start of the western entrance tunnel to the Coliseum, where Tirion Fordring greets them:[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Highlord Tirion Fordring says:[/b] Welcome, Warchief Thrall.  Overlord Hellscream.\r\n\r\n[b]Thrall says:[/b] Thank you for the invitation, Lord Fordring.  We look forward to observing these games.\r\n\r\n[b]Garrosh Hellscream says:[/b] Speak for yourself, Thrall.\r\n\r\n[b]Highlord Tirion Fordring says:[/b] I hope you will see the merit of these events in time, Garrosh.  We cannot win against the Scourge if we continue to war against one other.\r\n\r\n[b]Thrall says:[/b] Wise words.\r\n\r\n[b]Garrosh Hellscream says:[/b] Words of a fool, you mean.  The Horde will destroy the undead without your aid, human, or that of the pompous king.\r\n\r\n[b]Thrall says:[/b] Garrosh, enough!\r\n\r\n[b]Highlord Tirion Fordring says:[/b] Under my roof, gentlemen, I trust you will behave.\r\n\r\n[b]Thrall says:[/b] Of course, Tirion.

Be a paladin:\r\nSeriously, you'll need to block their hits as much as you can, and heal over 1k hps with just your judgement of light and seal of light.\r\n2. Be an awesomely geared paladin:\r\nI did this in ToTC gear, mix of 10 heroic and 25 normal, focussed on block, hitting 3k block value with my libram from ulduar 25\r\n3. Have time\r\nThey have a combined 4 million HP, even though you'll have some aoe on em it's gonna take a while.\r\n4. Now pull them!\r\nClear a few guards inside warsong hold, just enough to have a clear run out. Keep attacking either Saurfang or Garrosh, they can't be separated, but you can get rid of their guards by running out of the hold, this is probably a must, as the chance you'll be feared into mobs is rather high.\r\n5. don't get caught by the horde\r\nAny CC, any damage, will likely kill you. I did this in the middle of the night myself to avoid them.\r\n6. Don't let Saurfang evade\r\nSaurfang can fear you into funny places, you don't want that to happen. I ruined my first kite attempt (kiting him to the alliance camp in howling fjord) when he feared me into a nasty spot near the border of grizzly hills, when he started evading.\r\n7. Keep focussed\r\nDon't let your seals drop, don't let your judgement go off, keep holy shield up. If anything goes wrong, let them \"kill\" you, proccing argent defender. If you're still panicing, use Hand of Protection or Divine shield, heal yourself up (cancel divine plea before finishing the heal, refresh it once you're out of protection again). You have LoH as last resort. Satrinas scarab can help for a 4k \"heal\" as the temporary HP you get from it doesn't disapear.\r\n\r\nTips to speed up the kill while still \"soloing\":\r\nValiance keep is near, so are your faction friends. It's still quite a ride though and will take at least 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nFun things to do:\r\nSaurfang whirlwinds, don't forget to move him over any lowbies you meet.\r\nFYI: Saurfings whirlwind can hit me for 7k on 30k armor\r\n\r\nSome screenshots:\r\nTaken shortly after the pull and run from warsong hold:\r\nhttp://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b95/Mewnine/?action=view&current=WoWScrnShot_102709_020400.jpg\r\nDeath of Garrosh, easier time now as Saurfang is much easier to kite than the bugger himself, + garrosh only has 1 million HP:\r\nhttp://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b95/Mewnine/WoWScrnShot_102709_022339.jpg\r\nMining, as you can see saurfangs damage is rather predictable, he sometimes doesn't even attack you.\r\nhttp://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b95/Mewnine/WoWScrnShot_102709_024020.jpg\r\nShortly before Saurfang evaded on me:\r\nhttp://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b95/Mewnine/WoWScrnShot_102709_024020.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm going to kite them into Valiance Keep in a few minutes, to see how that works out.", "date": "2009-10-30T19:41:06-05:00", "rating": 22, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

After the growth and development they've given him across every expansion this game has had - starting all the way back in Nagrand, where he was the leader of the Mag'har Orcs - too ashamed and fearful that he'd turn out like his father to even lead properly. \r\n\r\nTo his brashness, and recklessness in Wrath - belayed by his power and skill as a warrior - and the potential setup to show that Garrosh and Varian weren't that different.\r\n\r\nTo Thrall finally realizing that his fault was putting the idea of peace above the pride of his own people, and naming a true Orc as Warchief - where, despite how \"wise\" and \"mature\" Cairne and Vol'jin were supposed to be, they acted like anything but. And showing us the first signs of not only leading the Horde to finally stand up for what is ours - but also the first signs of maturity and the enforcement of honor out of this young Warchief. \r\n\r\nAnd even, as Vol'jin started to plot against him, the patience to carry out a brilliant strategy, to draw the top Alliance generals to Theramore before its destruction - literally killing two birds with one stone. Nearly causing Jaina Proudmoore, of all people, to commit a travesty worse than Arthas was about to - when she decided to leave him. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the writing was on the wall. First we were forced to protect the very \"wise\" leader that threatened to assassinate Garrosh in the first place, and more recently began to plot against him, when he got what was coming to him. We were forced to side with Thrall, when Garrosh, rightly decided the Darkspear weren't to be trusted. I mean, one crazy Apothecary gets the Undercity guarded by Kor'kron - but put them in the Echo Isles, because the leader of the Darkspear threatened the life of the Warchief, and that's horrible?  And then, as if Blizzard realized how all this really looked, they decided to just finish it off by throwing Garrosh under a [i]fleet[/i] of busses. \r\n\r\nFirst there was Garrosh \"kicking the dog\" with that whole scene with Anduin ([quest=32399]), and his attempt to control the Sha. And then of course there was digging up the Vale, trying to capture the remains of a dead Old God ([zone=6733]). At this point, I think Blizzard has thrown every \"evil\" trope they could find at him, just to make sure everybody wants to get rid of him. \r\n\r\nAnd in the end, we have the pure-blood son of Grom Hellscream, who was so afraid that he'd end up making the same mistakes as his father that he couldn't even lead his own people, turn out exactly like his father. \r\n\r\nAnd for what? So we can see Green Jesus feel guilty, and feel sorry for the guy who would sell the Alliance Orgrimmar, if he thought it meant peace? So we can see that Vol'jin was right all along, even though, through Cataclysm and the start of Mists, he acted like a spoiled brat throwing a temper tantrum?
