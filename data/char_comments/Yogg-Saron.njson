{"commentv2": 1, "number": 2, "id": 690022, "nreplies": 6, "sticky": 0, "user": "128242", "body": "Okay, let's clear up some of this confusion about the Old Gods.  As someone pointed out earlier, the history on them is rather sketchy, and has been retconned several times just since the release of World of Warcraft.  The original lore regarding the Old Gods was that they were the first rulers of Azeroth, along with their elemental servants.  The Titans, in their crusade to bring order to the Universe, defeated the Old Gods and banished them deep beneath the surface of Azeroth.  5 of them are known to exist, three of which were imprisoned, and two of which were thought to have been killed.  C'Thun is one of the latter, who escaped death and imprisonment but was left nearly powerless in the barrens of Silithus.  The beast slain in the Master's Glaive was *assumed* to be the other missing Old God.\r\n\r\nWrath of the Lich King changed up lore a bit.  Rather than the Old Gods being first on Azeroth, they came after the Titans had created the mortal races and claimed it as their own, bestowing the \"Curse of Flesh\" that made the mortal races the way they appear today.  The Titans returned and that's when they banished the Old Gods.  It has not been established in WotLK how many Old Gods there actually were, so the number is still assumed to be 5, but it is unlikely they killed any of them, as there appears to be some reasoning why the Titans left the Old Gods alive. With that knowledge, and considering how important the Old Gods have become in lore, I severely doubt the beast slain the Master's Glaive ends up being an Old God, even if that was originally what he was meant to be.\r\n\r\nSo let's take a final tally.\r\n\r\n1. C'Thun - killed in WoW, presumed dead in lore.\r\n2. Yogg-Saron - appears to be killable, unknown if lore will hold that up.\r\n3. An Old God appears to be responsible for the Nightmare affecting the Emerald Dream.\r\n4. An Old God is presumed to have allied with the Naga, who gave them their current appearance.  He is likely located within the Maelstrom.\r\n5. Neltharion was likely driven mad by one of the Old Gods.  Whether this was one we know about or not is unknown.  Considering he now dwells deep below Grim Batol in caverns unknown by the dwarves, he could be having tea and crumpets with that Old God as we speak.\r\n\r\nSo is that our five?  Hard to say.  It's long been held that one of the Old Gods lived deep within Azjol-Nerub, but more than likely that's just Yogg-Saron pre-retcon.  One could also be imprisoned within Uldum, but there is no evidence of that, it just makes sense considering its sister-site Ulduar is a prison.  More information that one needs to know?

In order to endure the fight, you must use the Sanity Wells that appear around the room - these are large columns of green light.\n\n    *   [i][u]Sanity Well[/u] - [small]Standing in the well brings you back to your senses, regenerating 20% Sanity every 2 sec.

It gains a stacking buff which increases it's damage every time it is hit by direct damage.  The tank should run in and out to avoid putting extra stacks on it themself, and call for DPS to stop once the damage is too high in order to let the buff fall off.[/small][/i]\n\n    * [i][u]Constricting Tentacles[/u] - [small]Randomly spawn under a player, picking them up and immobilizing them, preventing them from casting most spells.

A group of DPS and a healer should be assigned to enter these portals.\n\nRaid Warning:  \"Portals open into Yogg-Saron's mind!\"\n\nOnce inside you will be in one of three events in Azeroth's past that Yogg-Saron has influenced. (Stormwind, Wyrmrest Temple or Icecrown Citadel).  You must kill the tentacles which are the NPCs until a raid warning states \"The illusion shatters and a path to the central chamber opens!\".  While destroying these tentacles, the group will take aoe damage from beacons located around the room as you pass them.  These will also reduce your sanity by 2%.\n\nAfter the tentacles have been taken care of, the path to the central chamber, \"The Mind's Eye\" opens, which contains Yogg-Saron's brain.  Also, all tentacles in the normal realm (outside of Yogg-Saron's Mind) become stunned and will stop attacking and using all abilities for a short time.\n\nRaid Warning:  \"The illusion shatters and a path to the central chamber opens!\"\n\nYogg-Saron's Brain has 6,860,000 HP and begins casting Induce Madness as soon as you enter his mind. \n\n    *   [u]Induce Madness[/u] -[small][i]Drives all nearby targets insane, reducing Sanity by 100%[/i][/small].\n\nPortals outside of his mind are spread around his room.  You must be quick to dispose of the tentacles and shatter the illusion so as to get as much DPS time in on the brain as possible, so you can take the portal out of his mind before he finishes casting Induce Madness.\n\nOnce Yogg-Saron's Brain reaches 30% HP, his shield will fade and his HP will drop dramatically (from around 55,000,000 to a more manageable 18,000,000).  All tentacles will cease to spawn, and the raid must clean up any remaining tentacles.\n\n[code][b]Phase 3: Immortal No More[/b][/code]\n\nImmortal Guardians will begin to spawn every 10 seconds, which have only drain life as an ability.  They also spawn with a buff stack which increases their size and damage done.  As they take damage, this buff will decrease making them vulnerable to Thorim's \"Titan Strike\" ability which kills them.  Otherwise, as suggested by their name, they cannot be killed. \n\nWhen an Immortal Guardian becomes low on health, Yogg-Saron will begin to channel Empowering Shadows:\n\n    * [u]Empowering Shadows[/u] - [small][i]Empowers friendly units within 20 yds. of the target, causing them to regenerate 750,000 health over 20 sec.  Instant cast.[/i][/small]\n\nOnce this spell finishes channeling, the target Immortal Guardian and any friendly units to it within 20 yards, including Yogg-Saron himself, will heal for a hefty amount.  The adds must be tanked so that Yogg-Saron, and preferably other adds, do not benefit from this buff.  You must kill Immortal Guardians before Empowering Shadows is finished casting.\n\nYogg-Saron will periodically channel Lunatic Gaze:\n\n    *   [u]Lunatic Gaze[/u] - [small][i]Looking into the maw of madness unhinges your mind, inflicting 5700 to 6300 Shadow damage and reducing Sanity by 4% every 1 sec. for as long as you are facing the caster.[/i][/small]\n\nThe Immortal Guardians should be tanked so that DPS can damage them while facing away from Yogg-Saron while he channels Lunatic Gaze.\n\nDue to the 15 minute berserk timer, adds may need kept busy to focus Yogg.", "date": "2009-04-25T10:25:31-05:00", "rating": 138, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "good guide. important points: 1 - you don't get sanity restoring wells unless you have freya helping you (which means no chance of mimirons head). 2 - in phase three, you need to look away from yogg while he channels lunatic gaze or you'll prolly hit 0% sanity before he's dead. 3 - in phase three, if you damage the adds the boss will heal if they are near him (so just single target the boss and don't AOE). it's pretty easy to solo at 90 as long as you can avoid losing yr sanity and the healing thing.", "creationdate": "2014-11-05T19:15:29-06:00", "id": 786378, "rating": 7, "commentid": 693166, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "zhool", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "This was absolutely awesome!

The curse of flesh, as seen in the Vyrkul cut scenes revealed in the Alliance quest lines of Howling Fjord, came after the Titans had already left, but before Loken's corruption became obvious and so is likely the result of some Old One plot to escape imprisonment, as was, in all likelihood, the premature awakening of the Earthen from their stasis in the vaults under Ironforge, Ulduman, and perhaps Gnomeregan. \r\n\r\nThe life forms that have been clearly stated to be Titan born so far are the Dwarves, Tauren, humans, and gnomes.  I'm not aware of any source that has definitively stated whether or not the Titans created the Trolls, Murlocs, Nerubians/Silithids, or other Beastmen species like the Harpies(though this could be the result of my own ignorance) so it may be that these were originally created by the Old Gods as playthings or soldiers in their war against the Titans and then later modified by the Titans after their victory, (as the Gorlocs claim to have been), or, like the Centaurs, they could be later creations of the Elemental Lords after the Titans left and they began to run riot again.  The strong traditions of worship towards the Old God and the Elemental Lords seen in the Nerubian/Silithid species and the numerous Troll tribes would tend to bare this out.

As we are slowly learning more about Deathwing, it is becoming firmly established that whatever has corrupted him lies deep within the earth, and that it was Neltharion's connection to the deep places of the world that made him particularly vulnerable.  Yogg-Saron has been trapped in Ulduar since the War with the Titans, quite literally placed in the \"roof of the world.\"  If Neltharion dwells within the deep places of Azeroth, Yogg-Saron would hardly be qualified to be that corrupting force.  After all, for a being as powerful as Neltharion, it would have taken very close proximity to drive him so completely mad.  What this suggests quite simply is that this Old God resides in or below Deepholm.  I'm sure as time goes on we will learn more about who, or what, this creature is.\r\n\r\nNow, as for Yogg-Saron's visions.  It is clear to me now that these visions are not showing events Yogg-Saron directly influenced.  After all, there is absolutely no evidence Yogg-Saron has anything to do with the Lich King, and that if anything the two are enemies.  So why the vision of the Lich King?  Garona Halforcen is now a character in the comic books, and nowhere in there has it been suggested that she has received any whisperings from any Old Gods.  So why the vision of her assassination of King Llane?  Simple.  They are simply acts of evil and/or treachery, designed to try and corrupt the player by showing the evils of the world.  Just like how in movies people are brainwashed by being shown horrific scenes to bring out their violent nature.  Remember folks, Yogg-Saron is not attempting to destroy the player, it is attempting to 'corrupt' them; to destroy their sanity.\r\n\r\nSo can we put to bed the \"Yogg-Saron corrupted Neltharion\" theories and accept that a new Old God is likely the driving force behind the events to come in Cataclysm?", "date": "2009-09-05T05:07:09-05:00", "rating": 6, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

When Garona killed King Llane, she was pregnant with Medivh's child, and likely carried some of Medivh's memories.  It's practically flat-out stated that was what caused Garona to murder Llane.

It was his intention all along to use it against his fellow Aspects..it was not the beginning of his descent, but rather the end.\r\n\r\n[quote]Additionally, it doesn't say anything about another Old God or even another force of any kind influencing Deathwing.[/quote]\r\n\r\nIt's only ever been stated Deathwing succumbed to the whsipers of the Old Gods.  It has never been stated who it was, and given that Yogg-Saron is no longer able to whisper to Deathwing and yet he's still as deadly and destructive as ever, someone is likely still pulling the strings.\r\n\r\n[quote]There wouldn't need to be an Old God behind the events of Cataclysm, Deathwing is crazy and evil enough to be motivated enough on his own. Deathwing is behind Cataclysm, just as all the announcements state.[/quote]\r\n\r\nHis craziness and evil was caused by the Old Gods.  He's not that on his own accord.  Now yes, he's probably fallen off the deep end by now, but he is most certainly working toward an end goal.  Given that he opened the way into the Four Elemental Planes which contain the servants of the Old Gods, he seems to still be working toward the Old Gods' ultimate goal: chaos.  And really...do you honestly believe Blizzard isn't going to introduce another Old God in Cataclysm?  They introduced Yogg Saron in spite of the fact he has absolutely nothing to do with the Lich King (the subject and namesake of the expansion), and yet you think they'll leave the Old Gods on the sidelines for an expansion about something they're actually intricately tied to?  Please.  This is Blizzard we're talking about.

Flesh, exactly. So the Old gods plan of retaking Azeroth were going preety well, until the Titans arrived and fixed everything again, they discovered the Earthen could not be healed as the death of the parasite would mean on their loss (loss of host) and so they remuved the parasite, but the curse remained, and the dwarves were born, that's why the dwarves racial is \"rocky skin\", it's the remnants of their ansestors the earthen, just as the humans ansestors were the Vrykul, then again cursed and weakened to become humans (the riddle in that is that even when you weaken the body the spirit remains, or that's what i think =P) so we could say that Blizz decided to go looking for the sasquach in northrend, and i don't mean the thing i mean the lost links of the only races which way they came to be was never written in the books implemented in the game.

Unfortunately, not everyone knows how to move, so with 1 keeper up (we chose thorim) sometimes we would get extra adds. More than 20 adds will easily wipe up the raid, as the tanks in the middle can't see where clouds are, and DPS can't DPS them down either.\r\n\r\nIn P2, we left more tentacles up than we should have, generally crusher and corruptor are OK to leave up as long as no one is near them. Constrictors are 2 shotted, and always spawn near the group of raiders stacked up. Constrictor>Corruptor>Crusher. Crusher tentacles barely do anything, except for their debuff, they do minimal damage and can be ignored. Corruptors put out many debuffs and THEY CAN ALL BE DISPELLED. Make sure that dispels happen. For the portals, we never could get it quite right, because DBM would usually screw up the timer. What i do have to say however, is that YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE PORTALS WHEN THERE IS AROUND 10 SECONDS LEFT. To exit the portals, there is a small portal in the back. But it is very far away from the actual entrance to the brain room, and if by the 10 second mark, you are not already heading towards it, you won't have enough time to get out, and you will probably wipe the raid. \r\n\r\nP3 is a 100% burn phase. Generally we could ignore the guardians, because Yogg-Saron had around 2 million health left. With 6 level 85 DPS, that goes down really quick, regardless of healing from the guardians.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Kill tentacles before entering the portals. If the tentacles are not dead by the time the portals are spawned, you might get 2 people inside, but debuffs will slow you down tremendously.\r\n\r\nInside the brain room, there will be skulls everywhere, and it is impossible to be facing one direction that is opposite of all of them. Just take out your tentacle, because the brain will quickly disappear. Shadowpriest and warlock are perfect for the brain room, because they can do damage and walk towards the end portal at the same time. As for portals, I had one person clear each side, and if we got more than 2 people in, had the other two go straight for the middle. The mobs inside have 8k health each, but make sure you don't bypass them. If even one is up with 100 health, you can't get inside the brain room. If you are alone in the brain room, you are technically insane. It is nearly impossible to take out all of the mobs, then get to the portal in time. \r\n\r\nThe brain itself has around 1300k health, but it takes around 600% more damage than Yogg-Saron will outside. IN OTHER WORDS: Doing 100k to the brain is around 2 million outside. Getting Yogg-Saron to 3 million (from 10 mil) triggers P3. Generally we could get to P3 in two shots, depending on how many we got in the brain room. \r\n\r\nBEST COMP FOR PORTALS: Have a DK DnD some of the adds, especially if you get in the room with adds bunched up. Heart Strike is insane here because it will take out an entire bunch of adds.\r\n\r\nDEMO LOCKS: Pop Demo and Hellfire. Make sure that your adds die though.\r\n\r\nWarrior: cleave and intercept are great, because you can take out multiple mobs at a time. Hit one, then cleave the other two (if you get in that room).\r\n\r\nThe worst room is definately the one under wyrmrest, because you can't AoE any of them.", "date": "2011-04-22T07:44:41-05:00", "rating": 15, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-04-22T09:07:10-05:00", 3, "wowgeek123"]}

The only way to damage her is the AoE damage from dying Guardians of Yogg-Saron. In order to end the phase, you have to kill 8 Guardians close to Sara. You can speed up the appearance of adds by touching green-yellow clouds. Some dmg can be avoided by using Twilight Ward.\r\n[i]P2:[/i] In this phase, you will need a bit of luck. Quickly kill any remaining Guardians from phase 1. Your Sanity will drop to about 30. Before the appearance of portals to the Mind's Eye, you'll have to deal with two waves of tentacles. The first wave will consist of Constrictor Tentacle (/tar macro is useful here), Corruptor Tentacle and Crusher Tentacle. The second wave will consist of Constrictor Tentacle and Corruptor Tentacle. Corruptor Tentacle is a priority. If it manages to cast Black Plague (24sec debuff, which periodically stuns for 2sec), you probably wipe it. Before the appearance of portals, all tentacles must be destroyed. Remember to avoid the green beams. After using the portal, your task will be to put Corruption on every neutral NPC while not facing Laughing Skull. Your minion has to be close to you, when going through the portal, otherwise it will not pass through it. Then you have to destroy Brain of Yogg-Saron, before it finishes Induce Madness cast. In addition, you need 1000 Demonic Fury for phase 3, so you have to be very fast in this realm.\r\n[i]P3:[/i] Nuke phase. Go to the back of the Boss and let your minion to tank adds. When Lunatic Gaze is casts, you have to turn away from the Boss. Watch out for Sanity, because if it drops to 0, you will become insane. Pop up all offensive cooldowns and pray that you do not become a victim of Black Plague. Yogg-Saron must die before Immortal Guardians will start to heal.

There's only one thing to say: RNG!\r\n\r\nThis took a lot of patience and coordination between us due to the fact that after Yogg appears in phase 2, any number of things can go wrong and wipe you. We always stacked in the same spot as a [url=www.wowhead.com/npc=33983]Constrictor Tentacle[/url] would immediately spawn when Yogg came out. We always stayed together due to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63802]Brain Link[/url]. We prioritized Constrictor > Crusher > Corrupter simply due to the fact that a lot of the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33985]Corrupter Tentacle's[/url] abilities will miss you, but you'll still be affected by debuffs regardless. Constrictor's had to be taken down asap for obvious reasons and Crushers can really hinder your dps if you ignore them too long. It's a pretty complicated strategy to type out chronologically, so I'll just give some bullet points for phase 2:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Always move together; never split due to Brain Link.\r\n\u2022 Brain Link will be dangerous past 20 yards and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=63830]Malady of the Mind[/url] will spread if players are within 10 yards of one another. Therefore, when you see Malady affecting your friend, get about 15 yards away and it won't jump (we did /range 10 to help with this if you use DBM).\r\n\u2022 Don't be tempted to run across the room to DPS a tentacle. Any number of bad things can happen and it's better to wait until phase 3 to clean them up. Manage the area you picked and deal with it.\r\n\u2022 Right as the portals come up someone will get constricted. Break him out before you enter.\r\n\u2022 Warriors: We agreed on how we were leaping and charging things as to not get separated and have Brain Link drain our sanity, so make sure if you are doing something similar to have that cleared up.\r\n\r\nThis strategy is also dependent on a quick brain phase inside. Our fury was able to dps the brain down to 30% with as little as 25 seconds remaining on the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64059]Induce Madness[/url] cast, and I'd help by shattering and dropping my Skull Banner with sunders of course. We decided for him to NOT use any 3 minute CD's in order to burn Yogg in phase 3 better which is why we needed a bit more time on the cast. Here are some things to keep in mind in the three possible rooms you can get:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Stormwind is your best bet and is fairly easy to avoid [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64167]Lunatic Gaze[/url] from the skulls.\r\n\u2022 Icecrown is decent as well but the middle group of tentacles can be nearly impossible to avoid skulls.\r\n\u2022 Wyrmrest can be the hardest due to skulls but we have seen fast clears when RNG is good.\r\n\u2022 The first attack made on a tentacle simply reveals them. You can do 23958723 damage as your first attack and all it does is unmasks the tentacle; the second attack is what counts. Each [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33943#comments]Influence Tentacle[/url] only has about 50k life each.\r\n\u2022 We decided that I would take care of the majority of tentacles while my Fury friend would be in position to get immediate dps in on the brain. Sometimes I would do all the work myself depending on his sanity level; key is to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn phase 3, we would clean up any tentacles from phase 2 before we would dps Yogg. I would get aggro on the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33988]Immortal Guardians[/url] and tank him about 25-30 yards away from the boss to prevent him from healing. The internal cooldown to Yogg-Saron's [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64163]Lunatic Gaze[/url] is 10 seconds. DO NOT get greedy and face him past this timer! Unless you got extremely lucky and kept a ton of sanity, this isn't recommended. My second wind healing in addition with T15 2 piece would keep aggro off my friend for the most part, but keep an eye to taunt and even use Mocking Banner if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe fury warrior spec'd into Vigilance as an external CD on me. I spec'd into Disrupting Shout to interrupt [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64160]Drain Life[/url] and glyphed into Rude Interruption for the 6% damage to help keep the Immortals' health pool down. I would time my dps cooldowns and defensives for [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=64486]Empowering Shadows[/url]. Second Wind healing should get you by as long as your are being smart with defensive cooldowns. I would re-position myself due to Immortals attacking me from behind right after a Lunatic Gaze cast. \r\n\r\nWith all that said, RNG will kill you. A lot. You will have to go into brain rooms with 2 sanity. Sometimes you'll go insane before then. Your friend will get constricted and you'll be affected with Malady + a stun with Brain Link = GG. Phase 2 is the true hump. Once you can get through that, it's more straight forward.\r\n\r\nWhy did we 2 man it? For the challenge! And [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=45693]Mimiron's Head[/url], which I already have but after beating our heads on this for 3 hours it actually dropped for my friend our first time and we'll never have to do it ever again!", "date": "2013-05-19T04:21:26-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 172, "id": 1873211, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "TheSlice", "body": "Soloable as a very well geared prot pala (540+ but less is possible, on a scale dependent on the RNG you experience in the fight).\r\n\r\nFor those unable to be in such gear, fear not, as it's also possible with a small group of 2 or 3 people -- 1 tank and 1-2 DPS. And here is how: -\r\n\r\n[u]Phase 1[/u]\r\nPretty easy, trigger some clouds and burn the adds on top of Sara. You want to end this phase with having all adds dead or just 1 alive that you kill before the tentacles start spawning.\r\n\r\n[u]Phase 2[/u]\r\nThis is where the real fun begins. I STRONGLY recommend you bring along a mage, a paladin and/or a feral DPS (symbiosis) for immunity abilities on the entire party. Why? Because Sara's chain-casted Psychosis beam, which depletes 12 sanity is programmed to stop on a target when it falls below 30 sanity; however, there is some delay in recognizing this change and determining that a character is no longer meant to be a valid target. Using an immunity when you drop below 30 sanity will ensure she targets other people, allowing you to enter the portals with as much sanity as possible.\r\n\r\nNow, regarding the tentacles. You should aim to kill as many Corruptors (600k that chain-cast debuffs on people) and interrupt Apathy and Black Plague (the rest are not important), especially Apathy since it slows you for 20 seconds by 60% and only dispellable by magic/immunity.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Constrictor tentacles which spawn every 15-20 seconds or so, should be DPSed down instantly (100k => paper). You should not need to kill Crusher tentacles but if all other tentacles are dead, you may as well. Tentacles will keep spawning until phase 3 so just try to stay on top of them as best you can.\r\n\r\nFor this phase you must also stay as a group, especially important for the Brain Link. When someone gets feared from Malady of the Mind, move away from them but stay in the Brain Link range too. I noticed that this fear usually only goes out once when I 2-man it; the mechanic *might* be the same for 3-man but I've not tested that much. So be aware of it.\r\n\r\nAfter 1 minute into phase 2, portals open (3 at each side, 1 at the room entrance side). A Constrictor tentacle will spawn at this time, so BEFORE entering, free the gripped person and also make SURE to hit a Crusher tentacle just before the last person enters a portal. That way you will lose one of the -20% damage debuffs, which will help you clear the adds in the brain room quicker.\r\n\r\n[u]Portal Phase[/u]\r\nInside the brain room, split up and DPS the adds down as fast as possible. It's also VERY important that you face away from the purple skulls while moving around and DPSing because you cannot afford to lose sanity since you don't have much to work with.\r\n\r\nOnce the adds are dead, nuke the brain. Decently geared people shouldn't need to use CDs but don't hesitate to do so if you're not sure you'll make it. Once the brain hits 30%, phase 3 begins.\r\n\r\nSpecial note: if you have a ton of DPS, one can exit early and clear up any remaining tentacles before bringing the brain to 30% since they will be stunned until that point.\r\n\r\n[u]Phase 3[/u]\r\nBegin the phase by going around the room and clearing all the tentacles as fast as possible. Kill the Corruptors first then the Crushers. Stun them and interrupt as many casts as possible (Apathy or Black Plague only).\r\n\r\nAfter that, the tank should focus primarily on holding the adds and moving them away from Yogg, so that Shadow Beacon doesn't cause the boss to gain healing stacks when it lands on the Marked Immortal Guardians. After it lands, the tank is free to come closer to the boss and let rip with some Vengeance buffed pewpew. But he needs to be mindful of the Beacon and move the adds well away before the next ones go out.\r\n\r\nThe other DPS can just focus on killing the boss.\r\n\r\nOh, and face away from the lightning (Lunatic Gaze, 4 sec channel) - don't go INSANE!\r\n\r\nAnd good luck on the mount! :)", "date": "2013-07-03T10:44:09-05:00", "rating": 2, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

[/b]Although it is possible for other specs, I highly recommend Survival. I suspect it got a ton easier with the recent change in 5.4, [spell=65301] no longer reduces [spell=63050], but is still a very hard and unforgiving fight. \n\n[b]Preparation:[/b] Get a DPS pet (I used a Ferocity specced Wolf) and a Tenacity specced pet ( I used a turtle) the DPS pet will be used in phase 1 and 2 and the tenacity pet for phase 3. I [u]HIGHLY[/u] recommend speccing into [spell=109212]. Agility food([spell=104275]), [item=49633], and [item=79257] isn't a must but certainly helps. [spell=56833] and [spell=56829] are [u]BOTH[/u] required. I also had [spell=20895], I wouldn't say it's required, but it is recommended.  I also had an easier time when I respecced into [spell=109306] and [spell=130392] (for the [npc=33983]s) for this fight, but it is doable without.\n\n[b][u]You will also need to make a macro:[/u][/b]\n/tar Constrictor\n/cast Blink Strikes\n/petattack\n/targetlasttarget\n\n[b]Use this whenever you get constricted.[/b]\n\n[b]Phase 1:(100%): [/b]Very easy phase, use the ferocity pet, put it on passive and move it into the middle of the room, directly where [npc=33134] is. Run through as many green clouds as possible, and as the [npc=33136] spawn, misdirect them to your pet as they run toward you. When you have about 9-10 [npc=33136]s attacking your pet, AoE them down, and she should push into the next phase.\n\n[b]Phase 2 (Outside):(100%): [/b]Remember to take pet off passive while [npc=33134] is transitioning into phase 2. [u]Now, 3 different tentacles will spawn; [npc=33983], [npc=33985], and [npc=33966]. The kill order is Constrictor > Corruptor > Crusher[/u], however your pet can most likely one or two shot the [npc=33983] if you are over 550 ilvl, they have very little health (about 100k). When you are constricted ([spell=64125]), you are unable to attack. Right when he transitions, You will be constricted right off the bat, use your macro (see above) and kill the [npc=33985] ASAP, before it gets a chance to cast [spell=64156] or [spell=64153] ([spell=64155]). [u]IT IS IMPORTANT TO KILL THEM FAST[/u], as if they are able to get these casts off it is a good chance that it may prevent you from killing the boss, as they greatly hinder you. (-60% movement speed for 20 seconds and stunned randomly for 24 seconds). [npc=33966]s aren't as important as the others, however should try to be killed when constrictors or corruptors aren't there, the Crushers put a debuff that reduces the damage you deal by 20% ([spell=64145]), which can stack if there are more of them up, so there really shouldn't be no more than 1 up at a time. [spell=63830] is annoying, however is not avoidable. After 1 minute, Brain portals will spawn around the boss, you will be constricted right when they spawn so have your macro ready, once the tentacle dies get into the portal.\n\n[b]Phase 2 (Brain):(100%-30%): [/b]There are three different visions to get while in Yogg-Saron's brain, Wyrmrest Temple, Stormwind Keep, and Icecrown Citadel. Within each vision there are 9 [npc=33943]s that must be killed, you must kill all 9 in order to attack the [npc=33890]. Also, try not to look at the [npc=33990], they drain your [spell=63050] by 2 every second your character is looking at them([spell=64167]). The ICC vision is definitely he best one to get, as the [npc=33943]s are very close together and you can just [spell=2643] them down and run over to The Mind's Eye, where the [npc=33890] is located, while the other two you must single target the [npc=33943]s down. Either way, hopefully you have about 35-40 seconds left on [npc=33890]'s [spell=64059] cast to run over in the brain room and DPS the brain once the tentacles are dead. The Brain needs to get to 30% and you need to run out using the 3 portals around the room to get back outside. Try not to use your DPS CD's these are highly needed for the last phase, but try to get the brain down to about 40% and run out (If you are Survival, your [spell=3674] and [spell=1978] should keep ticking while outside, and the brain will get down to about 30%, and you will have more time outside to kill extra tentacles outside before he transitions to phase 3).\n\n[b]Phase 3 (30%-0%): [/b]Quickly kill any remaining tentacles that are up (Corruptor > Crusher), and switch out to your tenacity pet. Use all DPS CD's on [npc=33288], he needs to go down fast, so many [npc=33988] are not up. Stand at max range from [npc=33288], so when he casts [spell=64486] he does not get healed (Try setting pet to passive, so he does not attack Yogg-Saron and move the adds to him, which will cause him to heal). Try to get the [npc=33988] to low health at all times, they won't do as much damage, and remember to misdirect them all to your pet. Just try to burn as much as possible and you can ignore the first few [spell=64163]s, but once your [spell=63050] gets to lower than 50 I recommend turning around to avoid [spell=63050] loss, while you are turned around you could use that time to get the [npc=33988] down to low health. You MUST have high DPS in this phase because the adds are unkillable, and there will be a LOT of adds 1 minute into the phase if [npc=33288] is not killed. Misdirect adds to pet, and try getting the adds low after he has cast [spell=64486], remember to use [spell=136] if your pet gets low, and turning around to avoid the [spell=63050] loss and he should go down. Collect loot for your unusable [item=45038] and 1-2% chance at [item=45693], cry that it didn't drop, and do it all next week.\n\n[b]Good luck to all the other Hunter Soloers looking to solo [npc=33288] 25M 0 Keepers for [item=45693], and I hope this comment helped you![/b]\n\nVideo of me soloing the fight: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqd7pWTyJ4g\n\n[small]Armory to my hunter: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/whisperwind/Scorpob/advanced \nFeel free to ask me any questions in-game if you are having trouble, or have any questions about this fight, or any others in the instance, I currently have the entire [zone=4273] instance on solofarm (Solo all bosses on 10, then go out and switch to 25 for [npc=33288]) every week until I get [item=45693] :P[/small]", "date": "2014-05-02T10:36:49-05:00", "rating": 58, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "\"solofarm (Solo all bosses on 10, then go out and switch to 25 for Yogg-Saron) every week \" Remember all, that Ulduar is the only instance in all WoW that you can do this (change from 10-25 and back at will), but remeber too that, if you do this while only having killed the leviathan, the whole instance resets.

Using flask, 300 food, kings drum, and Purification Potions.  Hope this guide helps a few people.\r\n\r\n[b]Key Talents:[/b]\r\n\r\nAstral Shift, Ancestral Guidance and Primal Elementalist.  The rest are up to you.  I took Echo in the fourth tier for the double MW heals, but EM is also good to take for the last phase.\r\n\r\nNote that Windwalk Totem does not remove the magic debuff that slows you Phase 2, and Earthgrab Totem does not root the adds in Phase 3, so the second tier of talents is completely worthless on this fight.  Thanks Blizzard!  -_-\r\n\r\n[b]Glyphs:[/b]\r\n\r\nFeral Spirit, Healing Storm, Flame Shock.\r\n\r\nYou can glyph Shamanistic Rage instead if you would like to cleanse the slow debuff, but I found the healing to be much more important, especially from the FS glyph in the last phase.\r\n\r\n[b]The Fight:[/b]\r\n\r\nPhase 1 is easy.  Pop Spirit Walk, run through a few of the clouds, then stack on Sara and kill the mobs as they come to you.  You'll need to kill 8 mobs on top of Sara to get Yogg to spawn.  Once she's at zero health, get out of the pool in the center of the room and heal yourself up if needed.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 is the tricky part, and you'll need a little favorable RNG here  Once Yogg is done with his speech, one of each type of tentacle will spawn, including a Constrictor that picks you up.  The only active attack that can hit this tentacle is Unleash Weapon.  The good news is that UE can proc your cloak, which also damages the tentacle.  So as soon as you get picked up, UE the Constrictor and pray for a proc (it should since you haven't been attacking anything for a few seconds at this point).  Once it's dead, hustle over to the Crusher.  Here's the trick: [b]Constrictors will not spawn if you are standing next to a Crusher[/b], so use that to your advantage.  If you are in range of a Corruptor while standing next to a Crusher, kill the Corruptor (and definitely interupt/ground [spell=64153] and [spell=64156]).  Otherwise, slowly DPS the Crusher down (to build up MW stack to heal yourself) but don't kill it yet.  Once the portals spawn, finish off the Crusher and get to a portal.\r\n\r\nIf you get picked up by a Constrictor on your way to the portal, use UE and hope you get a cloak proc.  If that doesn't work, drop your Earth Elemental Totem and click this macro:\r\n\r\n/tar Constrictor\r\n/petattack\r\n\r\nThat should hopefully be enough to break you out.\r\n\r\nInside the mind, if you have the [spell=64153] debuff on you, pop a Purification Potion.  Likewise, if you have the [spell=64156] debuff on you and you glyphed SR, pop SR.  Then pop Spirit Walk and kill all the mobs in the mind, avoiding Lunatic Gaze as much as you can.  Once they're all dead, go to the brain room, pop Ascendance and burn it down below 30%.\r\n\r\n[b]If you don't bring the brain below 30% on the first portal, or if you miss the first portal altogether, I strongly advise wiping and starting over.[/b]  The tentacles quickly get overwhelming and the frustration of constantly being stunned, slowed, mesmerized, etc is not worth it.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 starts as soon as the brain drops below 30% health, at which point you get kicked back out to the main room.  Kill all the remaining tentacles, starting with Corruptors if possible.  Make sure to spread Flame Shock onto all the Immortal Guardians that spawn.  This is where the FS glyph comes in handy.  As this Phase goes on, more Guardians will spawn, which gives you more mobs to spread FS to, which restores more of your health.  It also makes Fire Nova a very strong spell since they will all be grouped up on you and Yogg.  Once the tentacles are down, drop Fire Elemental Totem, lust, and burn Yogg.  Watch your sanity; if you're low, make sure you face away from him during Lunatic Gaze.  And keep spreading FS.  Not only do more Guardians spawn, but the ones you brought down to low health will jump back up to full health, meaning they really start to hurt.  Fire Nova should bring them back down fairly quickly, but make sure to use Astral Shift, Ancestral Guidance, and/or Healing Tide totem if you need them.  Rinse and repeat until Yogg is dead.\r\n\r\nHappy soloing!", "date": "2014-05-28T19:49:21-05:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "As of 6.0.2, Constrictor Tentacles will still spawn, regardless of your standing next to a Crusher Tentacle.

They get the mechanics at least partially down but no one mentions the huge amount of rng involved.  I solo'd this with a demo lock and I suspect the fight may be different if you have a pet.\n\nThis description is for 25 man version, 10 man was a lot easier to solo and the rng didn't seem to matter so much.\n\nPhase 1 is super easy.  You just get the adds to die on Sara.  Once her hp is down to 1 phase 2 begins.\n\nPhase 2 is where the rng really hurts.  You have tentacles randomly spawn and randomly grab you.  You have to either aoe them down or have your pet attack them when you are grabbed.  All the time you will have constant random dots happening that will stun you, interrupt, etc.  Around every 30 secs brain portals spawn, you want to be free to go into a brain portal as soon as they spawn (here's another place where the random comes into play).\n\nPhase 3 is totally rng hell.  This is entirely a race to get the brain to 30% hp or you die.  So if you are grabbed by a tentacle when the brain portals spawn and it takes you awhile to get free you lose that amount of time.  If you are unlucky enough to have a lot of slowing/stun debuffs on you you will lose time to that too even if you get into the portal.  Once in the portal you run clockwise killing stuff quickly and once everything is dead (different things to kill also depending on what brain scene you are in) the brain is open to be attacked.  I had all kinds of issues here, my lock pet would not follow me through the portal sometimes or it would just stand at the start and not follow me until i started attacking the brain losing me valuable dps time.  \n\nIf you don't go into phase 3 the first time the brain portals arrive chances are you will be overwhelmed by tentacles and their debuffs.  So I'd suggest you just wipe if you can't get into those first brain portals for whatever reason.\n\nPhase 4 is the Yogg fight.  Just face away from him when he does purple lightning.  Immortal Guardians will overwhelm you on this phase if you don't kill Yogg quick. \n\nReally not enjoyable, too much rng and too many bugs for my taste.

When you hear her say \"I am the lucid dream\", run out of the middle, kill the remaining adds and then immediately drop a magma totem.\r\n\r\nAt the start of Phase 2 and periodically throughout the phase, you will be picked up by a Constrictor tentacle.  The only ability we currently have that will damage these guys is Magma Totem.  If you try to drop one while you are picked up, you will likely receive a \"No Path Available\" error.  That's why it's important to drop the totem before the phase begins and keep it active throughout the phase (always refresh it after you kill one).  The key is that [b]Totemic Projection is usable while constricted[/b] so you can easily move your magma totem to your location when you get picked up.\r\n\r\nAside from that, stay relatively close to Yogg and kill the Corruptor tentacles as they spawn.  The spell you want to interupt is Black Plague, since that is the one that will give you the most issues.  If the portals are about to spawn, stay close to Yogg so you can get in asap (and keep Magma Totem down!).  Once you are in the portal, if you have Black Plague on you, cleanse it with a Purification Potion, and if you have Apathy on you, use Shamanistic Rage to clear it off of you.  Then kill all the adds in whatever scenario you are placed in, and then burst down the brain.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 starts when the brain drops below 30% and you get kicked back out to the main room.  No more tentacles spawn, but you do want to clear up the any remaining from the previous phase (Corruptors first, then Crushers).  Once they are down, focus Yogg.  Spreading FS to all the adds with FS glyph active makes you practically invincible so the only thing you really have to worry about is making sure your Insanity stays above zero.

If you're caught unprepared [i]there is no way to escape[/i], except dieing to the 15 minute enrage timer.\n\n2) While you'll be able to cast spells on some of the other tentacles (depending on the direction you were facing when caught), the [npc=33983] that actually catches you always counts as being behind you - and therefore cannot be attacked.\n\n3) Your elementals and Spirit Wolves won't attack the tentacle once you're caught. You can't drop your Magma Totem once caught, either - you'll get a \"[i]no path available[/i]\" error message.\n\n[u]So, come prepared![/u]\n\n1) Take the [spell=108287] talent, you can use it to move you Magma Totem once caught.\n\n(/edit)\n2) [i]Remove your Lightning Shield[/i] - you'll invariably disconnect from the server the first time you're caught by a [npc=33983] if you don't.\n\n3) Immediately drop and stand on top of your Magma Totem at the start of Phase 2. With luck, it will kill the first [npc=33983] to catch you. If not, use [spell=108287] to reposition it so that it does.\n\n4) For added security, move to a nearby [npc=33966], cast Flame Shock on it and move / recast your Magma Totem. You'll continue to be caught by [npc=33983]s but with luck either your totem will kill it, or you can cast Fire Nova and kill it with the AoE from the Crusher Tentacle.\n\n5) If you're an Engineer, you can also use your [item=60223] to shoot the tentacle. This is especially useful if you're pulled out of range of your totem and [spell=108287] is on cooldown (but the damage seems to be affected by [spell=64145] though, so use this earlier rather than later).\n\n\n\nGood luck! :)", "date": "2015-01-08T07:57:32-06:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "At last, something useful instead of stupid lore.", "creationdate": "2015-02-10T00:06:40-06:00", "id": 838397, "rating": -3, "commentid": 2084752, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 256, "username": "aragas11", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2015-02-12T08:50:36-06:00", 5, "trogstar"]}

Check out [url=http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33288/yogg-saron#comments:id=693166]this comment[/url] for an overview of the spells and mechanics.\n\nOn 10-man, during Phase 2, you will get hit by [spell=63795] until your Sanity drops to 37. You can't avoid this reduction. If you bring Freya with you for the Sanity Wells, you will keep getting hit by [spell=63795] endlessly. It's easier just to accept that you need to get through the fight at 37 Sanity. Prioritize killing the [npc=33985]s, because they can cast [spell=64156], which will reduce your movement speed by 60% for twenty seconds. If you get [spell=64156] just as the portals to the brain room open, you will most likely die to [spell=64059]. Stay as close to Yogg-Saron as you can, so you can jump right into a portal when they open. \n\nWhen the portals open, you have one minute to kill all the tentacles and enter the brain room. The timer starts when they open, not when you enter the illusion, which is why you need to stay close to Yogg-Saron. Efficiency is key during this phase. Start on one side of the room, and kill the tentacles in sequence as you go around the room. You need to avoid facing the purple skulls, as they will reduce your Sanity by 2% per hit, and you don't have much Sanity left to lose. The Wyrmrest Illusion is helpful, because the columns in the room can help block line of sight to the skulls. Strafing while keeping your back to middle of the room is also a good tactic. Once you get the raid warning that the illusion has dropped, get to the brain room as quickly as possible (it's a good idea to plan killing the tentacles so that you are close to the corridor to the brain when the last tentacle dies). Hit the brain with everything you can while on the run, and keep going straight to the portal out.\n\nYou should have done enough damage on the run through the brain room to advance to Phase 3. The fight is basically over now. You can probably ignore all the mechanics of this phase, and just DPS Yogg-Saron. He should be defeated in a few seconds. If he does cast [spell=64163], you need to face away from him. As a ranged DPS, I did not need to worry about the healing from [spell=64468], and melee DPS might have a harder time (though I doubt it).", "date": "2015-09-14T15:36:49-05:00", "rating": 43, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "If I could upvote a thousand I would.

Having never done this fight before, the loss of sanity almost drove me literally insane.\n\nA few tips to help avoid losing 100% of your sanity: \n\nTurn your back to Yogg, and those damn floating skulls as much as possible as you only lose sanity when you are looking at the caster. When soloing this can be a real pain. Note that standing behind the caster won't work because you are still facing them, the fact that they're not facing you is irrelevant. \n\nIf you have the help of the Keepers in phase one you can stand in the big beams of green light around the walls to restore sanity.\n\nMove as quickly as possible in all phases. The less time it takes you to get those tentacles down, through the portals and those mobs down, the less sanity you'll lose.\n\nWatch some videos! I failed to get him down several times after reading tips but killed him on the first go after watching a video, seeing someone else do it really helped. It didn't hurt that I was transported to the same illusion as the player I watched so I knew exactly which mobs I had to kill and where they were.\n\nI found the third phase to be a lot easier, I was able to turn my back on Yogg when he cast [spell=64163] , and being a higher level I was able to DPS him down pretty fast.
