Itchin' for a Stitchin' allows the Plushie to soak an attack and swap your pets. It seems to always pick the first pet you have, provided it's alive.

If two or more Orbs are still intact, they will pull you a couple of times. It can be pretty annoying, disorienting and a drain on the healer's mana. The solution is to DPS down the Orbs ASAP once Taran Zhu brings them out.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you use Meditate before you are gripped, you completely ignore the gripping part of the Orbs! You will remain in place without being tossed all over.\r\n\r\nJust use /focus on one of the Orbs and then use Meditate before they finish casting Gripping Hatred. Be sure to Meditate a second or two earlier just in case if one of the Orbs (if there are more than one, that is) gets Gripping Hatred off earlier. Meditate lasts for about 5 seconds, which will give you ample time to be \"immune\" to the pulls.\r\n\r\nIf you are already being gripped, you can still use Meditate to stop any further pulls if two or more Orbs are still intact. However, you will be meditating in the AOE, so be very careful.\r\n\r\nIf your group is really good and knows exactly when to Meditate, there will be no need to destroy the Orbs at all.\r\n\r\nThis will likely be hotfixed sooner or later, however... unless it is intentional.\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "date": "2012-12-06T00:35:31-06:00", "rating": -4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
