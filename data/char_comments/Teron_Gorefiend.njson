If you're using a bar mod add-on such as Bongos, you will not have your \"main\" bar get replaced by the Ghost bar. Instead, you will have to use your pet bar. \r\n\r\nI countered this by employing 3 macros set up on a different, unused bar that I make visible only during the Teron encounter. The macros read as:\r\n\r\n/cast Spirit Chains\r\n/cast Spirit Lance\r\n/cast Spirit Volley\r\n\r\nYou may also choose to macro Spirit Shield and Strike, however as they are not the most priority spells I feel just as safe click-casting them once my Constructs are dead. Macroing the critical spells and hot-keying them goes a long way towards cutting down your Constructs once you get hit with SoD.\r\n\r\nOne other suggestion-- start spamming Spirit Chains seconds before you die. You want to make sure that it gets cast IMMEDIATELY when you die and your Constructs spawn. Speed is everything here, the faster the Constructs get the inital lock-down the faster you can start tabbing through them to Lance them. Some people recommend doing a Volley THEN a chains, and this is fine if you're practiced enough with the Ghosts, but if not, opening with Chains is far safer. You will have ample time to drop your ghosts before they get to the raid even if you do not open with Volley.\r\n\r\nAfter that it's just a matter of practice. The game linked in this thread is good, but it is nowhere near as good as practical experience. \r\n\r\nThis fight is considered the best test of a raid's DPS, as the fight allows your DPS to do nothing but attack the boss unless they get hit with Shadow of Death. Because of the nature of Gorefiend's abilities, the higher your raid's DPS the better. Recommend opening with MDs onto the tank and Bloodlusts all around when able to make sure that both initial threat is high and that damage on Teron is high from the opening, so long as no one is generating more threat than your tank, of course.", "date": "2008-04-21T09:28:30-05:00", "rating": 14, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Bartender3 will automatically replace your first bar with your ghost's abilities.", "creationdate": "2008-04-30T17:44:35-05:00", "id": 333770, "rating": 0, "commentid": 275211, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "133472", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

But if threat is transferred, it is cast on you, being the only actual player in the encounter since you're soloing him. Advice from people is just simply don't have your pet out. \r\n\r\nWell, I went back to farm some Ashtongue Deathsworn rep last week and I proceeded to fight Gorefiend without any prior knowledge on how the fight worked, just assuming it was a tank n' spank with me being at level 90 with a 510 gear average. I killed him just fine and only after studying the combat log noticed that in the first few seconds of the fight, I pulled aggro from my bear and the \"Shadow of Death\" was cast on me. It wasn't an issue because he was dead about 20 seconds before the countdown hit 0. \r\n\r\nSo unless you're having problems getting him down in under 50 seconds, you'd probably never even know the debuff was cast on you.
