(as I'm sure most are aware by now)\n\n[item=50012] - Arthas' father was the king of Lordaeron, and Arthas after him (if somewhat selfproclaimed).\n\n[item=50428] - King [b]Terenas[/b] Menethil II was Arthas' father, killed by Arthas himself.\n\n[item=51799] - Forgotten love likely refers to Jaina Proudmoore, at one point his lover.\n\n[item=51798] - Uther [b]the Lightbringer[/b] was Arthas' mentor as a paladin, slain by Arthas not long after his initial betrayal against his father and kingdom.\n\n[item=50070] - The Order of the [b]Silver Hand[/b] is the original order of paladins, in which Arthas once was accepted. However, these paladins traditionally wielded warhammers, so it is hard to say to whom this could have belonged.\n\n[item=51795] - Muradin Bronzebeard helped Arthas find Frostmourne, unaware of its true, wicked powers, in order to help save his kingdom from the undead scourge. Muradin was severly injured when Arthas picked up the cursed blade, and was until recently thought dead. The injury caused a memory loss. He was found by the [b]frostborne[/b] and eventually elevated to their [b]leader[/b]. [edit] Now back in sweet home Ironforge.\n[item=49997] - Likely another reference to Muradin [b]Bronzebeard[/b].\n\n[item=50429] - [b]Antonidas[/b] was the first known leader of the Kirin Tor and ruler of Dalaran. He fell in battle during the third war when Arthas and his undead scourge came to Dalaran for the Book of Medivh, an artifact he needed to summon Archimonde into Azeroth.\n\n[item=50427] - [b]Kel'Thuzad[/b] was originally a wizard of the Kirin Tor who began practising necromancy, formed the Cult of the Damned, helped spread the undead plague across Lordaeron, was slain by the then-good Arthas, later brought back into the world as a lich with the help of the then-bad Arthas, and eventually found himself second-in-command of Arthas and the undead scourge.\n\n[item=51802] - Sylvanas [b]Windrunner[/b] was slain by Arthas while making her last stand before Silvermoon, and raised as a banshee in his service. She later broke free of his will and formed the forsaken undead.\n[item=50425] - Likely another reference to Sylvanas Windrunner, who was a renowned [b]ranger-general[/b] of Quel'thalas.\n\n[item=49981] - [b]Quel'thalas[/b] (the regions of the Isle of Quel'danas, Eversong Woods and the Ghostlands combined) was the home of the high elves, and was all but decimated during Arthas' unholy march on the sunwell. This weapon likely belonged to one of the elves. Maybe Sylvanas' spare weapon!\n\n[item=51797] - This I'm not sure how or why he acquired. Nordrassil is the previous (it's still there, actually [edit] as you can now behold in Mount Hyjal) and original world tree, nearly destroyed by Archimonde in Warcraft 3. Arthas played a part in summoning Archimonde to Azeroth, but did not otherwise participate in the assault on the world tree.\n\n[item=51803] - Arthas encountered Kael'thas Sunstrider, later to be known as [b]the Blood King[/b] (of the blood elves), at several occasions since picking up Frostmourne.\n\n[item=51800] - Illidan Stormrage, [b]the Betrayer[/b], was defeated (but not slain) by Arthas in the end of Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne, who was coming for the then-Lich King's aid.", "date": "2010-08-13T13:34:12-05:00", "rating": 76, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "still can you tell me WHY the hell blizz uses one or two models for weapons and armor in each instance?  i can understand this in case of armors but did you looked on those weapons?

Often such a creature is the result of a transformation, as a powerful magician or king striving for eternal life uses spells or rituals to bind his intellect to his animated corpse and thereby achieve a form of immortality.

While both are reanimated corpses, the difference lies in their intellect. Whereas a zombie is often depicted as mindless and/or under the control of some magician, a lich retains its independent thought and is as intelligent as a living human - and often, far more so. In some works of fiction, liches can be distinguished from other undead by their phylactery - an item of the Lich's choosing into which they imbue their soul, giving them immortality until said phylactery is destroyed.[/quote]\r\n\r\nTaken from [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lich]here[/url].", "date": "2011-02-18T08:36:21-06:00", "rating": 11, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

The fight is a 3 phase encounter, same as regular, 5 phases if u count the transition as 1. On phase 1, he will still summon adds, infect players with necrotic plague, AND in addition, he will summon Shadowtraps, which will kill your raiders if they stand in them, be sure your raiders understand that standing anywhere near it STILL can trigger the explosion. BEWARE. On the second phase, he will summon his Valky's along with defile, (Note that theres three Valks on 25 man) but the heroic mechanic adds more health the the valk, and at 50% they will let your member go, and spam shadowbolt till killed OR the phase ends, Defile remains the same, Gtfo, or you wipe your group. The third phase is the easiest. The first thing he will do is death grip all of your members into Frostmourne, and you will need to stack up, have your ranged kill spirits in the air, and run around to dodge bombs, (NOTE: When someone dies inside frostmourne, the LK gets 100% damage buff, this WILL wipe your raid on 25 heroic, and hurt your raid on 10 man heroic.

It's like, 25seconds to die to that from 100% hp without any heals..?\r\n\r\nLK has 18mil hp, and first phase changes at 70%. Second phase changes at 40%.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 162, "id": 1543729, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "matiasvidal", "body": "It's actually this way, if you build the lore and use it well:\n\nNer'zhul's spirit was bound into an armor set, particularly a Helm (Of Damnation). That said, Ner'zhul had to share the Power when the armor got a Physical body (Arthas). So Arthas was inside his own body connected to the Helm of Damnation, where Ner'zhul lurks. Arthas was able to shut Ner'zhul and rule over the body and armor, even the Sipirts held within Frostmourne. However, when Frostmourne shatters, all the spirits retake their power and purge Arthas, strip him of the souls he had taken, including his own, which returned to the Body - Arthas'. Do not confuse body with Armor/Helm of Damnation, while Arthas was the body and the ruling power, the real Lich King is and will always be Ner'zhul, the Helm of Damnation itself, the armor. When the Lich King was defeated, Arthas was the one who was defeated, not Ner'zhul, not the scourge, not the Lich King, Arthas. Just Arthas, who was killed in the process (Since he was the body, the Body was killed, and The Lich King's power returned to the Helm, though it's unknown if the Power's return awakened Ner'Zhul or if the power is held within the Helm without apparent use.) When Arthas died and the souls escaped, his own soul came back to his body, regaining control and sparing his final moments with his fathers' soul. Soon, the body died, and the spirit died too, ascended to heaven, or hell, or whatever spirit world there is. However, the Power was held within the Helm the whole time, Ner'zhul is the only owner of the power, Arthas was just using it. As the mindless scourge needed a Leader to withdraw and control their hunger, Bolvar took the Helm, thus taking Ner'zhul's power for himself, becoming a second body for the Helm - A second Arthas. He started talking to Tirion and, as he speaks, his voice changes to resemble that of Arthas when he had the Helm of Damnation. That said, we can guess that that's just the voice of whoever wears the Helm of Damnation, or whoever has the power of the Helm - Ner'zhul's power, OR that that Voice is actually Ner'zhul's (The Lich King) voice merging with the Body of the Armour. If we go with the first choice, it's impossible to know if Ner'zhul's still sleeping or just standing by, watching, letting the power cause destruction, or wether if he's still asleep. If we go for the second one, that means that Ner'zhul still sleeps inside the Armour and that the power is there for any body that took the Helm of Damnation (Bolvar) thus meaning that Bolvar has the control over the Lick King's powers and the Scourge itself. However, if we go for the third one, that means that Ner'zhul was never defeated, that Arthas never took the power of the Helm, that it was Ner'zhul letting Arthas use them, that it was Ner'zhul who was talking to Tirion. And, in the end, that would mean that The Lich King is far from over. Maybe Ner'zhul knew Arthas would die soon, or maybe he sits back and watches the show of his powers and the bodies that take them, or maybe we have to go by the other two choices.\n\nHope that clears out the confusion.", "date": "2011-10-15T16:02:30-05:00", "rating": -4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "responseroles": "8", "responseuser": "asakawa", "response": "", "lastEdit": ["2012-02-23T11:31:40-06:00", 2, "asakawa"]}

We basically just took them out by using AOE abilities like Keg smash/Breath of fire and chain lightning while still focusing on TLK. \n\nHe will also cast Infest, while will deal damage over time unless you get healed above 90%, so it's easiest to just try and keep yourself at full health as much as you can.\n\nHe also uses an ability called Necrotic Plague, which is a DoT that stacks up and jumps either when the target dies or it is cleansed - we didn't really notice this ability affecting us but if you see it pop up on yourself make sure you get it cleansed if you have the ability to.\n\nPhase transition: at 70% and 40% HP TLK does a \"transition\" phase where he runs to the middle of the platform and starts using a number of new abilities. He will run to the middle of the platform, cast Relentless Winter, and start casting Pain and Suffering very frequently, along with summoning frozen bombs that will throw you (possibly off the edge) if they reach you. You will want to get as far away from him as you can so you can kill the bombs before they reach you and minimize the damage TLK does to you.\n\nAt the end he will cast Quake, destroying the outer ring of the platform, naturally you should move to the middle when he starts casting this.\n\nHe will also summon Raging Spirit copies of your characters - make sure whoever IS NOT tanking TLK aggro's one and holds on to it, while the rest should be killed, which I'll explain why in...\n\nPhase 2: TLK  will continue using Infest, but instead of Shambling Horrors and Ghouls, he will now summon a Val'kyr Shadowguard which will try and pick up people and drop them off the ledge - HOWEVER - they will NOT pick up anyone who has aggro on something, hence why you should have saved a Raging spirit from the transition phase. If you didn't then you'll have to try and burst them down as soon as they pick up the other player.\n\nHe will also cast an ability named Defile, which appears on the ground and deals damage, growing larger any time it does deal damage, so get out of it as soon as possible.\n\nAt 40% there will be another transition phase, identical to the first.\n\nAfter this there was supposed to be a phase in which someone gets transported into Frostmourne, we however killed him so fast they he didn't have time to do this. At 10% he will cast Fury of Frostmourne killing everyone (unless you can a cheat death type ability to escape it maybe) at which time you have to watch a long RP sequence. at this point you've won the fight, once Terenas resurrects everyone TLK will be floating essentially stunned and you merely have to finish him off!", "date": "2012-12-16T10:45:58-06:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "\"- HOWEVER - they will NOT pick up anyone who has aggro on something\" Can anyone confirm this?

Best attempt on that link, 17% with death to enrage. I did stay on the stairs every transition. Another good attempt was at around 36% when i just messed up myself everything.

You pretty much need to get go T1 with only 2 shamblers. Fire nova from the adds also helps if everything is on cd. Just make your top priority towards LK. \nT1\nGo atop the stairs, and start slapping the spirit once it comes. Capacitor totem works wonders on Shamblers when they enrage. Position yourself so as the adds are near the throne, while you are \"under\" them. Well, few steps towards LK. This way the ice orbs shouldnt kick you around. Try aiming so that only one spirit is up after T1, preferably low hp. Use cds when they come up.\nP2\nFinish off the spirit, then the shamblers (they should be around 50% from nova/chains from the T1. Beware when they enrage and remember to throw HR right before P2, so that infest doesnt kill you if the spirit silences you. Remember to keep yourself near max at all times during P1&2 for Infest. That killed me so many times when it came at a bad time. P2 is not hard once adds are down.\nT2\nAt T2 I did a bit of dmg to LK while he was in the middle until the first orb spawned and then i ran to the stairs. There just kill the spirits. You should aim at 2 spirits left or less, using cds freely. This one is cheesecake compared to T1.\nP3\nHere you get ported immediately to mourne, just throw HST, HR and searing totem. ST is keeping the spirits in order quite nicely while HR and HST keeps you alive. When there's 2-4s left on timers to get back to LK, pop SBT and Sham rage in case of spirits silencing you immediately. I think I went after LK at this point, keeping myself alive and popping whatever comes from cd.

I'll leave it here for nostalgic purposes.\n\n[b]Soloed [npc=36597] on [url=http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=4584]25 Man Heroic[/url] for [item=50818] ([achievement=4625]) as a 539 BM Hunter with no legendary cloak[/b]. I tried with survival for good AoE to get the adds down, but I've found that the adds aren't even a problem unless you let them stack up without killing them. \n\n[b]Preparation:[/b] I used a Tenacity specced spirit beast, the extra [spell=90361] was needed greatly, especially in my gear. I [u]HIGHLY[/u] recommend speccing into [spell=109212]. Agility food([spell=104275]), [item=49633], and [item=79257] isn't a must but certainly helps. A core hound pre-cast [spell=90355] couldn't hurt either. [spell=56833] and [spell=56829] are [u]BOTH[/u] required. I also had [spell=20895], I wouldn't say it's required, but it [u]HIGHLY[/u] recommended. He is able to be taunted after enrage if you don't have the DPS to beat enrage timer, but this is [u]NOT[/u] recommended and is extremely hard, it is much better for you to wait until you have the gear/skill to beat enrage, which I'd say is about 525 ilvl.\n\n[b]Phase 1:(100%-70%):[/b] Arguably the hardest phase, have your pet tank [npc=36597] and adds on the edge of the platform. As usual, avoid [spell=73529] of course, and try to avoid getting aggro from adds so you can stay topped. [u]The part that makes this phase hard, is the [spell=70541]. When he casts [spell=70337] on you, you must heal through it, but at that time you are unavoidably under 90%, and if you get hit by an infest while under 90% health, you may as well use [item=95566] or die, because it's basically a wipe. The trick to avoiding the Infests are the pillars, as the Infests can be Line of sighted. Whenever he casts [spell=70337], it's almost certain he'll cast [spell=70541] right afterwards, so periodically get out of line of sight using the pillars in the room before Infest finishes casting, and it will be avoided, and you can continue DPSing while still avoiding [spell=73529].[/u] Unfortunately, the [spell=70337] cannot be Line of sighted. If you accidentally allow an Infest to hit you, you can use a  [item=76097] quickly to get above 90% and that will work as well! (however you can only do this one time through the fight). Once he hits, 70%, he will push into phase 2, and you most likely will still have adds up.\n\n[b]Phase 2:(70%):[/b] [u]Stay at the edge of the platform to avoid [spell=68981], you need to be at 90% or greater for next phase.[/u], don't worry about Lich king, just work on getting [npc=37698] and [npc=37695] down. You may kill the [npc=36701], however you WILL want to leave a few up during phase 3, as you need them in order to avoid the [npc=36609]. Kill the [npc=36633] ASAP, if you don't they will knock you back if you allow them to get to you. Phase 2 will end after about a minute. [u]Note:[/u] The [npc=36701] have an ability called [spell=69242] which is a silence, so it can prevent you from using [spell=34026] and [spell=136], but that shouldn't really be any problem.\n\n[b]Phase 3:(69%-40%):[/b] [u]Make sure you are topped off in health for phase 3[/u], as he continues to cast [spell=70541] during this phase, and there are no pillars to avoid them from. He doesn't cast [spell=70337] in this phase anymore, so as long as you get out of [spell=72762] ASAP and don't get aggro from extra [npc=36701]s and/or Lich king himself, you should be fine. [u]You [b]WILL[/b] want to use [spell=20736] every minute on a [npc=36701], as it will mark you as tank and the [npc=36609] in return will not pick you up.[/u] DPS the Lich king down to 40%. [u]Remember:[/u] At any time if he casts infest on you and you are under 90% health, it's a wipe.\n\n[b]Phase 4:(40%):[/b] Once he is down to 40%, [u]he will no longer cast [spell=70541][/u], so it is safe to stand in the [spell=68981] and DPS the Lich King all you want. Don't get too greedy and die to the AoE though. He will spawn more Raging spirits, these don't really need to be killed and most likely just die to [spell=115939] over time anyways, just DPS lich king and kill [npc=36633] ASAP just like in phase 2. If you start losing a lot of health, go to the outer edge to get out of the Remorseless winter, and wait it out with Spirit Bond and Spirit beast heal, better to be safe than sorry. Phase 5 will start after about a minute.\n\n[b]Phase 5:(39%-10%):[/b] Don't worry about being topped off or using distracting shot on raging spirits, he will no longer cast Infest or spawn Valk'yr in this Phase. As long as you have the DPS to beat enrage timer, getting to this phase means you've basically already won. There are still a few drawbacks and things that may still wipe you however; As usual, get out defile ASAP, and once in a while he'll use an ability called [spell=73654], which will pull you into [item=36942] with [npc=36823]. You are stuck inside Frostmourne for 40 seconds, after which Terenas will pull you out. This is mostly just a hinder to DPS and will not wipe you, just be sure to kill the [npc=39190] inside if they start running for you. Once you are out of Frostmourne, The Lich King will spawn [npc=37799] and these you may mostly ignore, you will most likely be topped anyways due to Spirit Bond and Spirit beast heal anyways. He will most likely pull you into Frostmourne 2-3 times, once you get out its best to use CDs and DPS him as much as possible before he casts it again. Once he reaches 10% you've won.\n\n[b]Phase 6:(10%-0%):[/b] At 10% he casts [spell=72350], killing you (you may not be killed if you use [spell=19263]). Role-play will commence, after it is over, just DPS him down. No further explanation needed. Once he's dead, collect loot for your 1-2% chance at [item=50818], cry that it didn't drop, enjoy the cinematic, and do it all again next week.\n\n[b][u]EXTRA[/u]: Being epic and surviving [spell=72350]:[/b] I've played around with surviving this attack and can say that if you have over 1 million health, you'll survive (usually only if you have full SoO heroic gear) or if you have over 700k health, you CAN survive it if you use [spell=19263], as this reduces damage taken by 30%, and the attack does 1,000,000, you will only take 700k, thus surviving the attack (Probably need about 540 iLvl to have over 700k health with the buff (Alliance:[spell=73828] Horde:[spell=73822]).\n\n[b]Good luck to all the other Hunter Soloers looking to solo the Lich King on 25M Heroic for [achievement=4625], and I hope this comment helped you![/b]\n\nVideo of me soloing the fight: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7oQcDq38HH0\nVideo of me surviving [spell=72350]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mManaCXPDEE\n\n[small]EDIT: [u]547 iLvl with [item=102248] and am now one-shotting this every week, 10 attempts so far but still no mount.\nEDIT2: 560 iLvl and I can kill him in about 5 minutes (there was 10 minutes left on enrage) 31 kills, no mount yet)[/u]\nArmory to my hunter: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/whisperwind/Scorpob/advanced \nFeel free to ask me any questions in-game if you are having trouble, or have any questions about this fight, or any others in the instance, I currently have the entire [zone=4812] instance on solofarm (Solo all bosses on 10N, then go out and switch to 25H for Lich King) every week until I get [item=50818] :P[/small]", "date": "2014-01-14T22:24:13-06:00", "rating": 16, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2014-10-18T03:09:05-05:00", 33, "BscorpobBx5"]}

I pulled it off at i577, with some deliberate preparation:\n\n[b]GEAR:[/b]\nI use an i588 staff, i616 dps cloak, i582 Sha trinket, i567 Siegecrafter trinket, mana meta gem, and 2pc set bonus (+10% Crit during AA). Mana wasn't really an issue.\n\nFor dps, switched my reforges/gems to Haste>Crit. I valued Haste for a few reasons: extra cloak procs, extra Mindbender hits, extra glyphed Smites+Penance cooldown reduction, and Haste converts more efficiently to 1% than Crit (425 vs 600).\n\n[b]PREPARATION:[/b]\n1.) I grabbed Int flasks/pots/food, Drums of Rage, and Healthstones (from an LFR).\n2.) I waited for Shan'ze Dao dailies at Shado-Pan and grabbed an Int/Crit buff from the mage NPC. This NPC buff sticks when you zone into ICC, unlike a mage player's buff. If you hold a Shan'ze Dao daily in your quest log, this buff will always be available.\n3.) I ported to Hyjal for a Stats buff from the druid NPC on the Protectors of Hyjal daily.\n\nThus, my stats were: 60,420 spellpower, 37.3% haste, 37.6% crit, 27.3% mast, 9960 spr\n\n[b]TALENTS/GLYPHS:[/b]\n1.) Angelic Feather, hope you're comfortable with a keybind for this\n2.) Mindbender, major dps cooldown\n3.) Twist of Fate, massive uptime\n4.) Divine Star, to fish for ToF procs and target Ice Spheres that get close\n5.) Glyph of Penance, duh\n6.) Glyph of Smite, respectable dps boost assuming Haste\n7.) Glyph of Reflective Shield, minor dps boost and passive ToF procs\n8.) Glyph of Sha, removes gcd from Mindbender\n\n[b]PRE-FIGHT:[/b]\n1.) Start the fight dialogue, then move to the bottom of the stairs so that your feet are OFF the ground. Thus, the Shadow Traps will NOT knock you back, but they WILL interrupt your casts.\n2.) As Tirion says \"So be it,\" remove all your gear then immediately re-equip (to start with ToF). Prepot. Drums of Rage. (Use macros+equip sets to simplify this.)\n3.) You might PW:S for the BT proc; you're at ~15% health anyway.\n\n[b]PHASE 1:[/b]\n1.) Mindbender, Penance, Holy Fire, SmiteSmiteSmite. Archangel. With +10% Crit and Drums+prepot+ToF+trinkets, you should be smashing his face in.\n2.) Don't move from this spot until 70%.\n3.) Ignore the adds but start firing Divine Star on cooldown and/or as needed to extend ToF uptime. PW:S yourself as needed (e.g., during Lucidity procs).\n\n[b]KITE PHASE #1, AT 70%:[/b]\n1.) He runs out-of-range to the middle. Run over and Smite him a bit, but reserve Penance/Holy Fire for...\n2.) ...the first Raging Spirit to spawn. Forget about Arthas, and kill these things ASAP. [b]This is the make-or-break element of the fight[/b] (other than the enrage timer). He spawns 3 of these ~20sec apart, and they cast a frontal cone-silence that screws you for 5sec. Do NOT get hit by it.\n3.) Until the Raging Spirits die, run around the edge of the arena with Feathers, kiting out-of-range of the Raging Spirits' silences. They cast it once every ~10sec; if you successfully avoid one, you might sneak in a few Smites before resuming the kite, but in general you should be running because Ice Spheres are chasing you anyway. (If Ice Spheres get close, a Divine Star can kill them all. Otherwise, focus on Raging Spirits.)\n4.) Ideally, you'll kill the 1st Raging Spirit as the 2nd one spawns. If multiple are up, you need to be running at ALL times, and this is a dps loss to be sure. Use Penance, Holy Fire, SW:P, SW:D, Mindbender, etc. while running.\n5.) If you get in trouble while silenced, try hitting an item (e.g., Healthstone/Rocket Boots).\n6.) If you have trouble finding Raging Spirits among the mass of adds, you may want a /tar macro.\n\n[b]PHASE 2:[/b]\n1.) With the last Raging Spirit dead, resume dps on Arthas. No more Shadow Traps, no Valkyrs, just Defile.\n2.) There are probably still 3 Shambling Horrors up. That's fine; you can use them for ToF procs.\n3.) They periodically Enrage, and below 20% health they gain a second buff called Frenzy. You get hit hard here, so be careful. You may want to blow your defensive cooldowns, kite a bit with Feathers, and/or drop SW:P/SW:D on them when they are low (also for ToF procs).\n4.) Mostly though, focus on Arthas.\n\n[b]KITE PHASE #2, AT 40%:[/b]\n1.) Same as before but with fewer adds up. However, Arthas spawns 4 Raging Spirits instead of 3. [b]Again, this is make-or-break.[/b] Ignore Arthas, kite the Raging Spirits/Ice Spheres, and kill the Raging Spirits ASAP.\n2.) Arthas pulls you into Frostmourne at some point. probably with 1-2 Raging Spirits still up.\n3.) While inside Frostmourne, use Hymn of Hope if needed, run around with Feathers to avoid the ghosts, and wait it out. Shield yourself if needed, but try NOT to trigger a trinket proc here. The dps race is getting intense at this point.\n4.) When you port out of Frostmourne the 1st time, resume the kite until the Raging Spirits die. Then, resume dps on Arthas. You may notice that any remaining Ice Spheres have gotten \"stuck\" in the middle of the arena. That's fine; just avoid and/or Divine Star them.\n5.) After ~60sec, Arthas pulls you into Frostmourne again. Watch his channels and try to SW:P him right before he ports you; he casts both Defile/Vile Spirits twice, then he ports you ~10sec after the 2nd Vile Spirits channel.\n6.) While inside Frostmourne the 2nd+3rd times, watch your trinket/Mindbender cooldowns. You want to pop another pot+Drums immediately after one of these Frostmourne phases, ideally with Mindbender+trinkets up and Arthas under 35% (for ToF).\n7.) If he pulls you into Frostmourne a 4th time, expect to hit the enrage timer.\n8.) At 10%, he casts Fury of Frostmourne. Pain Suppress yourself to survive it, and dps him and any remaining Shambling Horrors during the lengthy RP. If you make it this far, congrats and good luck on your 1% mount chance!\n\nThe strategy requires practice to get down. If you have heroic gear, you may want to practice mechanics/kite phases and die to enrage before you go through the trouble of flying to Townlong/Hyjal for the mage/druid buffs. I had attempted this last patch, without the buffs, and died to enrage at 19% on my best try (remember: you win at 10%). Just now, I one-shot him but probably beat the enrage timer by a matter of seconds, considering he was just about to pull me into Frostmourne for the 4th time when he hit 10%. I actually didn't think I was going to make it, but a timely trinket proc may have been the difference. Good luck and godspeed!\n\nEDIT: Week 2 and again I one-shot him. This time I cleared ph1 with only 2 Shambling Horrors up. Despite being pulled into Frostmourne 3 times, I finished the fight at 217k dps on the meter, about two-thirds on Arthas and one-third on adds.", "date": "2014-05-21T17:28:39-05:00", "rating": 2, "indent": 0, "roles": 16384, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2014-06-24T16:39:10-05:00", 13, "maely"]}

Anyway, moving on!\n\nBefore the Lich King becomes target-able lay down an explosive trap and snake trap, for some added DPS, as well as using your [item=76089]. Also ensure that your pets [spell=2649] is enabled. Your pet will most likely not need the tanking spec, as the damage it takes is nearly non-existent and can easily be handled with the Spirit Bond talent. Worst case scenario a single Mend Pet will easily keep your pet alive.\n\nThen continue to use [spell=3045] as well as [spell=121818] once the Lich King is target-able. \nHe will continue to summon [spell=70358] and [spell=70372]. A quick Multi-Shot will easily take care of the Drudge Ghouls before the next spawns. The Shambling Horror isn't much of a threat and can easily be kited. He will not often hit you, if at all due to the mob only being level 83. He should however, be taken care of as soon as possible. As having necrotic plague can leap between you and him, and can easily cause a wipe.\n\nYour main concern during this phase is the [spell=70337] and [spell=70541] combo that he will occasionally due. Having DBM (Or similar boss mod add-on) with WotLK fights is incredibly helpful as it will let you know when these spells are about to be cast, and how close together they will be. If both these abilities occur at roughly the same time, and you are within 85-89% health, quickly counter with a [spell=781] to get yourself back up at 90% to remove the [spell=70541]. The Spirit Bond and an additional Disengage should be enough to get you through the [spell=70337]\n\nIf you are below 80% health, it is unlikely a Disengage and your Spirit Bond talent will be able to heal you back up to 90% or higher before [spell=70541] starts hitting too hard and you will die. In this event, you will need to use your Healthstone.\nWith a little patience, and getting used to the mechanics, you should have the Lich King hitting the transition phase.\n\n[b][u]Transition Phase[/u][/b]\nIf you haven't already, finish up any adds that have survived through the first phase. Quickly move to the edge of the map to avoid taking continuous damage from [spell=72259]. The Lich King will summon [spell=69200] during this. You should kill these down as quickly as possible. You will also need to keep an eye on [npc=36633] that spawn. They only have around 50k health and can easily be taken out with a single Serpent Sting. Try to keep your DoTs on the Lich King as much as possible during this phase.\n\n[u][i]Optional[/i][/u]\nThis can make the second phase easier, but I had no luck with this in my experience, but I feel I should mention it, in the event that it does work. Leave one of the summoned Raging Spirits alive from the transition phase, and bring him with you into phase two. This shouldn't be too difficult to manage, as the spirit doesn't do much damage when he actually manages to hit you.\n\n[b][u]Phase Two[/u][/b]\n[i]If you are using the Raging Spirit: [/i]\n\nMake sure your pet is strictly focusing on the Lich King. Having the Raging Spirit alive, and tanking it yourself. (Not your pet) Is supposedly an effective way to grant your character immunity from the Valkyrie grabbing you and dropping you off the edge. However I never had any luck with this strategy. If you can manage it, it will make the phase significantly more simple, as almost all damage will be focused on your pet, and he can be easily kept up with a continuous Mend Pet. Just be sure to dodge the defile pools and focus the Lich King down and bring him into the next transition phase.\n\n[i]If you are not using the Raging Spirit:[/i]\n\nYou will need to disable your pets growl ability, as well as dismiss your pet and re-summon him to ensure the Lich King has aggro on you, and not your pet. This will grant you immunity from the Valkyrie picking you up and throwing you off the ledge.\n\nHowever, now you have to deal with tanking the Lich King, as well as [spell=69409] and [spell=70541] these combined at roughly the same time can be incredibly devastating and can easily kill you. Never stop kiting the Lich King at any point, this will help in mitigating his melee damage. When the Lich King uses Soul Reaper quickly disengage, he should shortly pause again in order to cast either Defile or Infest. If he uses Defile first, just continue to kite him as best as possible, using disengage on cooldown. \n\nIf he uses Infest, counter by using Deterrence and continue kiting, using disengage on cooldown. If you start dropping below 75% health while the Infest debuff is still on, use another healthstone, it should be off cooldown by now.\nJust rinse and repeat, and with a little luck you should reach the next transition phase.\n\n[b][u]Transition Phase[/u][/b]\nJust do what you did for the last one, except there is absolutely no reason to leave any Raging Spirits alive any more. Just kill em' dead!\n\n[b][u]Phase Three[/u][/b]\nIt is absolutely one-hundred percent safe to turn back on your pets growl ability. The Valkyrie will no longer try to pick anyone up and throw em off the edge! Hooray! The rest of the fight is absolute gravy from here on out. You will on occasion get slurped up by Frostmourne, but that isn't a big deal. Just shoot the adds up in the air and hang out till you get sent back. Continue killing the Lich King. Occasionally a horde of spirits will come chasing after you, but the damage they do is minor and no real concern. Just continue moving and DPSing the Lich King. When he gets down to around 10% health, congratulations [i]you're winner![/i]\n\nHope this guide helps, and good luck to those farming the mount.

Use voidwalker for add control up until the end of the first intermission. When LK starts calling Val'kyr, either dismiss the voidwalker or use grimoire of sacrifice. Voidwalker is safe to use during the intermission phases because the Val'kyr won't grab you. Try using drain soul on the ice orbs with glyph of soul consumption to keep your health up for infest. The final phase is easy (keep VW dismissed/sacrificed), every time you get pulled into Frostmourne, you can tab target/drain life/drain soul on the adds to keep your health up.\r\n\r\nRogue: Don't have many issues with this class. I run it as Assassination, haven't tried the other two specs. Use cloak of shadows to get rid of the plague in the first phase if necessary. Use fan of knives just outside of melee range from the ice orbs to get rid of them. Consider talenting for shuriken toss for the final phase inside of Frostmourne, you can work up combo points to put into recuperate to help survive the phase.\r\n\r\nWarrior: I usually use Arms during this fight. For talents, I usually run with second wind and dragon roar, the rest doesn't matter as much. To keep your health above 90% to survive infest, try to keep some of the lesser ghouls alive. For now, they're still 'honorable' targets, you can kill them and get a victory rush proc that can heal you up. Glyph for victory rush if you need it. For ice orb, you can either whirlwind (and risk killing the ghouls, if you find yourself needing them) or use heroic throw from range. For the Frostmourne phase, you can kill the spirits with heroic throw and use the following victory rush to keep your health up.\r\n\r\nHunter: I usually have the easiest time as Beast Mastery. Talent for crouching tiger, hidden chimaera, spirit bond, and stampede. Glyph for liberation. Pet is your choice, but I recommend a corehound for the bloodlust. Spirit bond will help keep your health up, but if you find yourself being carried away by Val'kyr (sometimes you are, sometimes you aren't, it's buggy atm), you can survive to the end by dismissing the pet and using disengage to keep your health up.\r\n\r\nDruid: I've only done it as Balance. The only thing worth talenting/glyphing for is Ysera's gift. Add control is pretty easy with starfall, allowing you to focus down LK. Pop rejuvenation/healing touch if you need to (for infest). The fight is simple aside from that. Prioritize the reflections as they spawn, they have a silence that can be chained, that alone can ruin the attempt.\r\n\r\nPaladin: Retribution. Talent for selfless healer, the rest are subjective. Cleanse the disease when necessary. Ice orb can be taken from range with judgment or exorcism.

In actuality, your original plan was to simply enter the Halls and find anything of value. This plan then swells to include stealing Frostmourne, and THEN to slaying the Lich King.\n\nOf course, the latter does not come to be. Upon entering the halls, Sylvanaas (Horde), or Jaina (Alliance) casts a spell to unleash all the spirits in Frostmourne. Uther the Lightbringer is freed and has a discussion with the guide, revealing some rather interesting info, and telling them that it would be suicide to try and kill Arthas there. The conversation is interrupted as the Lich King strolls in and banishes Uther. He then proceeds to take the spell and summon his lieutenant's-in-life, Falric and Marwyn. Your guide rushes after him, and, of course, locks the door behind them.\n\nYou, the so-called heroes, must then fight off 8 waves of very strong trash and 2 bosses before you can enter the next hallway that leads to the Shadow Throne, the inner sanctum of the Lich King. You arrive just in time to see your guide get her butt kicked down to bout 200k and some health. Before she can die, though, she stuns him, and runs off down a secret passage with you, leaving the still at 20 million hp Arthas to shake off the stun and run after you.\n\nThis fight is not a real \"fight\". Rather, the Lich King creates frost barriers to cut you off, and while your guide works at them, you must defend her from waves of undead. After he has summoned the wave and the wall, he will activate Remorseless winter, a completely crap ability that slows him down to an abnormally slow pace. This conveniently gives you ample time to run away. However, if you somehow, by means retarded, manage to run afoul of the abnormally slow King, he will kill your guide before using Fury of Frostmourne, a.k.a, the Automatic wipe. He will cause a complete wipe of everyone in the instance, so its no use running away from him. This has caught my group alot and due to the fact that not many people know that it is instance-wide ranged, it has led to much frenzied breaking for the entrance portal. And trust me, nothing is better than seeing a massive, heavily armoured bloodlusting orc being one-shotted in mid-jump, and falling headlong down the stairs in the Throne Room.\n\nWARNING:This section contains spoilers!\n[spoiler]Upon breaking through the tunnel, you make your way to a stone obeservation platform on the side of Icecrown glacier-a dead end. By the way, the next few moments are great screenshot points. As Arthas closes in on you, your guide valiantly shouts her defiance to the Scourge's master. Her words are in vain, however, as with a single flick of his blade, the Lich King sends a coil of energy lashing in her. He slowly begins to drain her soul......when just as it seems all hope is gone, the Ogrim's hammer/Skybreaker explodes out of the clouds. Arthas rushes towards you, but the airship bombs the cliffside, sealing the tunnel, cutting off the powerful spell draining your guide, but more importantly, saving you from the Wrath of the Lich King. A ramp comes down, and offers you transportation to the deck of the airship, revealing a consort of heavily armed guards, a portal to Dalaran, and a shining chest of treasure...[/spoiler]", "date": "2009-12-15T00:45:17-06:00", "rating": 12, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "responseroles": "8", "responseuser": "Gryphon", "response": "", "lastEdit": ["2011-04-13T23:36:19-05:00", 2, "Gryphon"]}

Whatever outcome we get in wow can't have been decided upon when the lore was first written as back in the day there was no Argent Crusade or Knights of the Ebon Blade, the LK most powerful adversaries. \r\nAt the start the lore says Kil'jaeden imprisoned Ner'zhul's spirit in armour which was itself encased in ice and hurled it into the northern reaches of Azeroth with the task of weakening Azeroth in preparation for a second invasion from the Legion. So at the start Ner'zhul has nothing but then discovers he can control the dead with his mind, roll on the war with the Nerubians and the beginning of the Cult of the Dammed. Ner'zhul uses Arthas as a tool to break away from the Legion (beats Illidan) free his spirit from the throne and as a consequence their spirits merge.\r\n\r\nNow even though Frostmourne was just a tool to capture Arthas Blizzard have suggested the sword itself may have a will and/or motives. The most annoying thing I find is the soul of Uther suggesting that there must always be a LK to hold control over the scourge and that the last fragment of Arthas is holding the scourge back from totally annihilating the world. Utter bs. If Arthas' remaining humanity has any sway over the scourge why has it grown at all since he became the LK and not just gone and turned in on itself? The scourge didnt exist until there was a LK and after he is killed it will be destroyed, only powerful liches and DK's can ressurect and reanimate the dead and once the LK himself gets destroyed its only a matter of mopping up the rest to finish the scourge completely.\r\n\r\nAnd speculation on the new LK should another have to take Arthas' place, it's either Darion or Tirion and my money is on Darion", "date": "2009-12-12T13:26:55-06:00", "rating": 0, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

He did indeed (as we already know) survive the battle at the Wrathgate. Being tortured by Arthas, Bolvar still refused to become his servant and champion.\n\nAfter the death of Arthas Menethil, Tirion was ready to take his place as the new Lich King in order to keep the Scourge at bay. However, just before he put on the Lich Kings' crown, a familiar voice shouted out to him.\n\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon, engulfed in fires still burning from the purification of Alexstrazas' red flame that was used to cleanse the Wrathgate, called out to Tirion. He convinced him to put the helmet of the Lich King on his head instead. Bolvar also told Tirion that none must know what truly went down in Icecrown Citadel that day, as if people were to realize that a Lich King was still alive, they could not avoid to live in fear and panic for the rest of their lives.\n\nRefusing at first, Tirion finally did what Bolvar asked him to. The eyes of the Lich King opened up once again, covering Bolvars'. The soul of one of the mightiest beings ever seen on Azeroth had corrupted a man who was pure at heart and true to all he believed in. Bolvar sealed himself as the Lich King in a block of ice and told Tirion to leave and never come back. This was the only way that Bolvar could aid the world now. He would forever keep the Scourge away from Azeroth.\n\nThe man who did something so great for the world he loves would be forgotten to cover up the existence of the Lich King. The man who boldly put the crown of the Chill of the Damned would do so without anyone knowing. And by the years he would always protect his beloved world in silence.\nThough no one would ever come to realize it, know that the end of the Scourge didn't come without a price. The world would've been destroyed if it wasn't for him.\n\nEven though his existence was meant to fade always remember Highlord Bolvar Fordragon.

If the scourge is so deadly as a rampaging horde then frankly the Lich King should have struck by now. Rampaging horde backed up by just a little coordination should equal win. However I can buy that the Lich King has been biding his time, willing to wait until victory is certain. It seems reasonable, the guy is immortal after all.\r\n\r\nHowever what I cannot buy is this idea that without the will of the Lich King holding them in check all scourge would go on a mindless rampage. Sorry it just doesn't hold up. Thrice times have we seen scourge freed from their masters will (Forsaken, Battle for Lights Hope Chapel, and Shadowvault). Never have they become mindless monsters that tore across the landscape killing all in their path. \r\n\r\nI have a final problem with this scenario. WotLK has given us a few chances to interact with dominated scourge. They have always come across less as mindless automatons driven by one iron will and more as an intriguing mix of different personalities. Simply put the scourge appears to have a culture to equal any other race on Azeroth. I feel this is most obvious with the abominations. They share characteristics first built up with their forsaken counterparts, naive, friendly in a dim way, slow but loyal. Ignoring their appearance they come across as quiet lovable. But it goes further then this, from Drakuru's ghiests skiving off work to his well-mannered butler giving you a guided tour.\r\n\r\nFar from becoming a greater threat I see a released scourge more likely to want to find a new place in a world once again opened up to them.

The frozen crystal, warped and scarred by its violent descent, came to resemble a throne, and Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit soon stirred within it. From the confines of the Frozen Throne, Ner'zhul began to reach out his vast consciousness and touch the minds of Northrend's native inhabitants. \r\nThe term \"Frozen Throne\" literally applies to this crystal, about the size of a tauren in full armor. Kil'jaeden crafted the original from ice in the Twisting NetherWRPG 28 (which was massive \u2014 probably about the size of a decent castle) to house Ner'zhul's (now the Lich King's) soul. The harsh entry into Azerothian airspace and the impact with the glacier greatly reduced its size. \r\n\r\nIllidan Stormrage was charged by Kil'jaeden with destroying it, and to this end recovered the Eye of Sargeras and brought it to Dalaran. Illidan and his Summoners used the Eye, combined with Dalaran's natural magical energies, to send devastating earthquakes to destroy Icecrown and the Frozen Throne. The intervention of his brother Malfurion, his former jailer Maiev Shadowsong, and Prince Kael'thas stopped Illidan from succeeding, and he fled. \r\n\r\nKil'jaeden ordered a second attempt and so Illidan, along with his enemies-turned-servants the Blood Elves and Lady Vashj with her Naga, personally invaded Icecrown so that Illidan could smash the Throne in person. \r\n\r\nIllidan again failed, and Arthas smashed the Throne \u2014 releasing Ner'zhul's spirit and forcing the two to merge into the new Lich King. \"Frozen Throne\" now most nearly means the remnants of the crystal that Arthas physically sits upon, as an actual throne.

You see they fused their soul and body and then some simple math.....                                         Arthas Menethil + Nerz'hul = The Lich King\r\n\r\nIn one way both of them are there but in another a new creature was born when they fused their souls.\r\n\r\nI dont remeber where this next part where taken from but somewhere i remember someone said the following, \"The little shred of Arthas that's left in The Lich King may be the only thing that keeps him from destroying the whole of Azeroth.\" (correct me if im wrong). Now i don't know if Nerz'hul thinks that we deserve our land destroyed but simply Arthas thinks not. \r\n\r\nNow there's something about Arthas make's me think that from the very first beginning Arthas only thought he did what he had to do. Example's: If Arthas didn't purge the city Stratholme then Mal'ganis would've had multiple reinforcements to play with, and if he didn't pick up the frostmourne then he would'nt have killed Mal'ganis. By the way when he picked up Frostmourne then something happened within him. \"tho the one that wields the blade shall have power eternal, so must it scar the spirit.\" arthas didn't care of the \"death\" of muradin because he was blind to the revenge of his people and he just claimed the frostmourne. \"so must it scar the spirit\" one less shred of arthas. He wielded that blade since the day he picked it up, and he's soul must have been transformed ALOT. Next time when he picked up the crown of the lich king he also had to share his body with Nerz'huls spirit.\r\n\r\nNow some of the last of he's words after he lost Frostmourne and lost the crown: \"Father!......Is it over?\" i think during the process he went through with frostmourne and the crown he was tormented in some way and couldn't belive he acctualy was freed. He maybe was tormented in such way that he didn't want to slaughter his people and was terrified by what he did. That is at least my way to see upon the lich king and Arthas.

The spirit moved into a human in Warcraft 3, turning the human into an undead Necromancer, starting the Scourge. Frostmourne is actually separate from Ner'zhul's spirit itself. It was merely a tool of corruption. It wasn't until later that Ner'zhul actually possessed Arthas, becoming the Lich King. It's a really interesting story.[/quote]\n\nNer'zhul was an Orc, and a Shaman, not an Ogre, nor a Mage \u00ac_\u00ac\n\nfurthermore: he was anything but crazy, he was one of the single most intelligent Orcs to have ever lived by some accounts, considering he is the one who united the scattered clans and formed the very first Horde. Also, he was not possessed by any \"rebel legion sorceror\", he was tricked into making the first blood pact with the Legion, which then used thier newly aquired Horde to wage war on the Draenai ( Kil'Jaeden's revenge on Velen ). The key word here is tricked, not possessed, and tricked by Kil'Jaeden no less, not some \"rebel sorceror\".\n\neven-further furthermore: the re-opening of the Dark Portal did not blow up Draenor, because, incase you didn't notice, in warcraft 2's expansion, when the portal was re-opened, we WENT INTO DRAENOR, it had not exploded. it was the opening of multiple [i]other [/i]portals ( which you can find ingame as we speak in Nagrand, Zangarmarsh and a few other locations ) that caused too much stress to the planet and was the cause of it's implosion. Infact, a full TWO YEARS happened inbetween the events of Warcraft 2, and the destruction of Draenor.\n\neven-further-than-that furthermore: Ner'zhul did [i]not[/i] turn into a human necromancer, that is Kel'Thuzad and he is an entirely different character. Kel'Thuzad himself, has an evil soul, and it took little more than promise of power to convince him to serve the Lich King. Ner'Zhul did not brainwash him or possess him. Kel'Thuzad [i]willingly [/i]serves the Lich King.\n\nI-dont-know-if-this-is-possible-but-even-MORE-furthermore : the opening of the portals is not what killed him, because he's not dead... \nNer'zhul was caught in another dimension/world immedaitely after fleeing through one of his portals from Draenor ( it was this act, Ner'Zhul and his followers using the portal, that caused magical backlash and tore Draenor apart, forming Outland ), by Kil'Jaeden himself, and was tortured for his treason, his body was destroyed, and what was left of his soul was sent to to the Icecrown Glacier where it was bound to the Lich King armor, sealed within a massive block of glacial ice.\n\nYou are right about one thing, it is a very interesting story, it's just a shame you don't have a clue about it.", "date": "2008-10-23T02:15:46-05:00", "rating": 37, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Mhm.

Not ARTHUS, like king Arthur, but ARTHAS.\r\n\r\nTwo: \"Rules many lands\"? Everything the Scourge has a presence in is entirely mixed, and not ruled by anyone. The only place that the Scourge really actually owns is Icecrown, since there's only two or three non-Scourge or vrykul bases there.\r\n\r\nThree: His body is human, yes. HOWEVER, his mind is both orc and human; a mix of both Ner'zhul and Arthas (thus the, \"We...are...ONE!\" in the WC3 TFT undead ending cinematic).\r\n\r\nFour: \"Friendly to the Plague\"? You can't be friendly to a damn virus. You either catch it, cure it, and live, catch it, slowly die of it, and then die, not catch it at all, or catch it and just overpower it with your #$%^ing godliness (which is very likely to be what would happen with the Lich King). I'm sure the Plague would infect the Lich King if he came into contact with it (not like it would actually do anything though).\r\n\r\nFive: \"he had to kill his friend to wield the sword\"? There are a few things wrong with that. ONE: NO, he didn't HAVE to kill his friend, one of the spikes just happened to hit Muradin when he released the sword. TWO: Muradin is ALIVE, therefore, he never killed his friend in the FIRST DAMN PLACE.\r\n\r\nSix: \"Arthas is a human that is controlled by overwhelmed power\"? First of all, if my experiences with bad grammar were all but many, I could honestly not tell what you're saying. AT ALL. Second: You should be using past-tense there. Arthas WAS a human that WAS controlled by overwhelmING power. Arthas doesn't exist anymore, and neither does Ner'zhul: there is only the Lich King now.\r\n\r\nSeven: NO, NO, AND NO! He is NOT Lich King because of Frostmourne. He is the Lich King because he took Ner'zhul's helm and they MERGED.\r\n\r\n...As for what's correct?\r\n\r\n\"he is a traitor to both horde and alliance\"\r\n\r\nThat's it.

Initially trapped within the Frozen Throne, the Lich King eventually merged with the human Arthas Menethil. He is the creator of the Scourge and rules over it telepathically from his throne atop the Icecrown Glacier.\n\nThe Lich King will be the main antagonist in the upcoming expansion World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. \n\n[b] Birth of the Lich King[/b]\n\nWhen Ner'zhul left the dying world of Draenor, he was immediately captured by Kil'jaeden. The demon was eager to take revenge on the orc, who had turned his back on the Blood Pact he had sworn years earlier. Ner'zhul's spirit was kept alive while his body was slowly torn apart. Entirely at Kil'jaeden's mercy, Ner'zhul agreed to serve the demon once more; exactly as the Deceiver had planned. Ner'zhul's spirit was encased in the Frozen Throne, a mystical block of crystal. Encased in the ice he felt his consciousness expand ten thousandfold, while being warped by Kil'jaeden's power. The orc that had been Ner'zhul ceased to exist, and the Lich King, a being of unfathomable power, was created.\n\nAs the ranks of the undead swept across Lordaeron, King Terenas' only son, Prince Arthas Menethil, took up the fight against the Scourge. As was the Lich King's intention all along, Arthas succeeded in killing Kel'Thuzad, but even so, the undead ranks swelled with every soldier that fell defending the land. Frustrated and stymied by the seemingly unstoppable enemy, Arthas took increasingly extreme steps to drive them out - he eventually ordered the slaughter of everyone in Stratholme, which had been infected by the plague, to prevent Mal'ganis from adding them to the army of the dead. Finally Arthas's comrades warned him that he was losing his hold on his humanity.\n\nArthas' fear and resolve proved to be his ultimate undoing. He tracked the plague's source to Northrend, intending to end its threat forever. There he stumbled across his long-time friend, Muradin Bronzebeard, brother to the dwarven King Magni, and the dwarf led him to a legendary weapon they hoped would help them combat the Scourge. Instead, Prince Arthas himself fell prey to the Lich King's tremendous power. Believing that it would help him save his people, Arthas took up the cursed runeblade, Frostmourne. Though the sword did grant him great power, the cost was high: Muradin lay dead, and Arthas began to lose his soul, transformed into the first and greatest of the Lich King's Death Knights. Arthas finally exacted revenge upon Mal'ganis, removing one of the Lich King's more dangerous jailers and completing the unholy transformation. With his soul cast aside and his sanity shattered, Arthas led the Scourge against his own kingdom - Lordaeron. Arthas murdered his own father, King Terenas, and crushed Lordaeron under the Lich King's iron heel. \n\n[b]Path of the Damned[/b]\n\nWith Arthas as his champion, Ner'zhul spread the Plague throughout Lordaeron. What remained of the Order of the Silver Hand struck back, but even mighty Uther fell to the Death Knight's power. On orders from Tichondrius, Arthas took the Scourge north, to the high elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas, to resurrect the Summoner of Archimonde - Kel'Thuzad. The high elves never stood a chance, and their capital, Silvermoon, was ravaged - their millennia-aged Sunwell warped and used to resurrect Kel'Thuzad as a lich. Thus, both masters were appeased: the Lich King's most loyal worshiper was returned, and the Summoner was unleashed.\n\nHaving progressed too far into the Legion's plan (and guarded too closely by Tichondrius) to back out now, Ner'zhul's minions laid siege to Dalaran, reclaiming a spellbook of Medivh... which contained the incantations needed for Kel'Thuzad to summon Archimonde.\n\nFinally, Archimonde was summoned in Dalaran, and he immediately gave control of the Scourge to Tichondrius and the Dreadlords. But the Lich King was not done yet. Archimonde may have removed Ner'zhul's control over the undead, but in his eagerness for vengeance against the night elves, he forgot to return the Frozen Throne to Kil'jaeden. Thus, the Lich King remained at large.\n\nDuring the Legion's invasion of Ashenvale, Illidan Stormrage was released from his barrow prison after ten thousand years of captivity. Realizing Illidan's addiction to magic, and having utilized the Skull of Gul'dan himself years earlier, the Lich King dispatched Arthas to Kalimdor. There, Arthas covertly told Illidan about the powers of the Skull of Gul'dan. Unable to resist such power, Illidan took up the skull and harnessed its vast energies. By doing so, Illidan developed demonic features and vastly magnified power. Illidan, exactly as the Lich King had planned, then proceeded to kill Tichondrius and liberate Felwood.", "date": "2008-07-23T23:30:43-05:00", "rating": 41, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "And our greatest weapon for the attack on the Lich King will be global warming", "creationdate": "2009-08-26T22:33:40-05:00", "id": 118588, "rating": 10, "commentid": 334395, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "149707", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "[quote]And our greatest weapon for the attack on the Lich King will be global warming[/quote] The ice stone has melted!", "creationdate": "2009-10-25T02:42:14-05:00", "id": 129040, "rating": 5, "commentid": 334395, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "makho", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2008-10-21T23:11:27-05:00", 2, "Taleras"]}

Warcraft 3 veterans likely remember Arthas' voice as being... younger I guess, while this one seems older. The LK's voice is actually most likely Ner'zhul's, as he was the original LK as stated by someone above(Taleras). It isn't far fetched to say Ner'zhul destroyed Arthas' soul and took his body for himself, he specifically states in [u]Path Of The Damned[/u] that he hates humans, why would he share king-ship with one?\r\n\r\nThat probably isn't a 100% success process. In ye olde Naxxramas one could hear the LK's voice (pre-WotLK) as being, if listening carefully, kind of like Arthas and Ner'zhul speaking in unison. Could be Ner'zhul being open-minded and trying a duo monarchy (forgot the term for it. x,x). In the WotLK trailer you can hear a voice that sounds like Arthas, once again not far fetched for someone of Ner'zhul's power to sound like Arthas. \r\n\r\nAs far as his character goes, while we dont know much about Ner'zhul per se, in WotLK he seems to be taking a hands on roll, stroking his e-peen everywhere in Northrend. That seems alot like how Arthas was in a way, and while I myself haven't had a whole lot of expereince with Ner'zhul, his character seems like he would be more of a away-from-the-front strategist, getting others to do his biding. Could be he absorbed Arthas' mind and this was a side effect (I'm gona eat your brains and gain your knowledge!).\r\n\r\nContradictory to the above paragraph, it could simply be that after being frozen for several years he just wants to move around a bit.\r\n\r\nI hope I've cleared the air with this Great Wall of Text. the Lich King and his voice is not Arthas, it's not Frostmourne(\u00ac.\u00ac); it is Ner'zhul.", "date": "2009-09-11T15:01:01-05:00", "rating": 2, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

He sought to defy Kil'jaeden after discovering his true intentions, but Kil'jaeden was warned by [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Gul'dan]Gul'dan[/url] of his impending betrayal.  Ner'zhul was allowed to live to witness the corruption of the Horde and the subsequent [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/First_War]First[/url] and [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Second_War]Second Wars[/url].  When the Alliance invaded [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Draenor]Draenor[/url] following the Second War, Ner'zhul began opening portals to other worlds in attempt to escape Kil'jaeden's wrath for failing to conquer Azeroth.  Upon crossing through a portal, Kil'jaeden apprehended Ner'zhul and tore his spirit from his flesh, but kept him alive, allowing him a chance to still serve the Legion.  Kil'jaeden granted him unfathomable power, and imbued his soul to a runeblade and a suit of ancient armor, creating the entity known as the Lich King.  Kil'jaeden sealed the armor and blade within a [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Frozen_Throne]frozen crystal[/url] and cast it into Azeroth, where it fell upon [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Icecrown]Icecrown Glacier[/url] on the remote arctic continent of [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Northrend]Northrend[/url].  Using his will alone, the Lich King created the Plague of Undeath, killing the denizens of Northrend and resurrecting them as his mindless slaves.  His human agent [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Kel'Thuzad]Kel'Thuzad[/url] brought the Plague to [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Lordaeron_%28kingdom%29]Lordaeron[/url].\n\nPrince Arthas Menethil, a paladin of the human nation of Lordaeron, was assigned to investigate the Plague.  He watched in horror as citizens fell to the disease and were resurrected to fight against him, diminishing his faith in humanity as well as forcing him to question his peers and motives.  He tracked down and killed Kel'Thuzad, but the undead holocaust continued unchecked.  Seeking to end the Plague at its source, he traveled to Northrend, where he acquired [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Frostmourne]Frostmourne[/url], believing it could grant him the power to end the Plague and be the salvation of his people.  Unfortunately, Frostmourne was the runeblade Kil'jaeden bound to the soul and will of the Lich King.  The Lich King's voice commanded him, and proved to be the tipping point that made him turn from the Light and humanity.  He returned to Lordaeron as the first [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Death_Knight]death knight[/url] of the Scourge, killing his [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/King_Terenas]father[/url] the king, laying waste to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3487]Silvermoon[/url], corrupting the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=4075]Sunwell[/url], resurrecting Kel'Thuzad as a [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Lich]lich[/url], invading [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Dalaran]Dalaran[/url], and assisting in summoning [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17968]Archimonde[/url] into Azeroth.  With the arrival of Archimonde, the Lich King was no longer needed by the Burning Legion and secretly turned against them to ensure his survival.\n\nFollowing Archimonde's defeat on [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3606]Mount Hyjal[/url], Arthas eliminated the remaining Burning Legion and human forces from Lordaeron.  The Lich King's power began to wane and Arthas was called back to Northrend.  There he was met with opposition from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22917]Illidan Stormrage[/url] and his new [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Blood_elves]Sin'dorei[/url] and [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Naga]Naga[/url] forces.  Arthas defeated (but did not kill) Illidan, and rose the steps of [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Icecrown_Citadel]Icecrown Citadel[/url] to meet his master.  At the Lich King's command, he burst open the frozen throne, releasing the enclosed armor.  Upon crowning himself with his helm, Arthas' soul conjoined with Ner'zhul's, creating one of the most powerful entities to ever walk Azeroth.\n\nMore details on the history of the Lich King are outlined in [i][url=http://www.blizzard.com/war3/]Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos[/url][/i] and [url=http://www.blizzard.com/war3x/][i]The Frozen Throne[/i][/url], as well as in [i][url=http://www.wowhead.com/?object=175748]The Birth of the Lich King[/url][/i], [i][url=http://www.wowhead.com/?object=175762]The Lich King Triumphant[/url][/i], and the [url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/story/story.xml]official site[/url].\n\nThe Lich King is a primary, but thus far unseen antagonist for both Alliance and Horde in the World of Warcraft.

They plan to add a new mount type, Old god boss, and 2 new BGs.Listen for more info.\n                                                       \nThe new expansion will be Barbie: Wrath of the !@#$% Queen. The new mount will be a pink dream limo that holds up to 10 people, including 3 vendors, a pool and a suicide booth. The new old god will be none other then the barbie overlord. She can nearly 1-shot the best tanks and is said that she drops a legenday chestpiece called \"The bra of a thousand truths\". It can instantly turn the wielder into a barbie, or drain the target's mana to 0, and inflict 30k damage, with no CD. One of the new BG's is \"The fight for the mall\". It is an all out battle where the goal is to capture and hold stores in the mall, and whoever takes control of the mall first wins the match. The other BG will be \"The siege on the mall\" one team has control of the mall and the other tries to destroy the walls of the wall,breach it, and slay the enemy leader with cold blood. It is believed to be a SotA/AV like battle. The attacking force has a 20 siege engine limit, and if they dont breach the mall with 20 siege engines they lose the game, the mall, and their super-stores.

You begin to battle the armour + spirit of Ner'Zhul.\r\nPhase 5: Final phase: Tirion is slain by Ner'Zhul and the ashbringer dual wielded (in corrupted form) by Ner'Zhul. Increases damage + speed in this phase, rather like an enrage.\r\n\r\nAftermath: Once you have slain Ner'Zhul and the armor falls to the floor, Arthas regains consciousness. After regaining his strength, he picks up the Corrupted Ashbringer, which immediately turns back to it's holy form at his touch, and he dons Tirion's armor, hence, Arthas becomes the new ashbringer. Frostmourne will be destroyed in an event upon handing it in for a quest to Rhonin.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is only what I think / want to happen. None of this is 100% sure. Tell me what you think.) \r\n\r\nI think there is something wrong with my reply link***", "date": "2009-10-12T18:49:06-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2009-10-12T18:52:17-05:00", 1, "436033"]}
