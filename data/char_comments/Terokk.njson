I found I could get the 40 scrolls needed to summon each mini-boss within the 20 minute duration of the Elixir of Shadows.  The easiest way to do this was to mount up on my flying mount and go to the platforms in up in the trees and circle around the area aggroing all the Time-Lost mobs and AoEing them down.  Be aware that becoming airborne even for a second will cause all mobs on you to reset, so be sure to stay on the ground.  Going in a circle around Skettis doing this, I never ran out of respawns.\r\n\r\nThe mobs drop cloth, trash, greens, and the occasional blue or lockbox (the 71 mobs can even drop the Froststeel WOTLK lockboxes, so you can actually get some decent stuff doing this.), I vendored everything except the blue BoE items because of the economy of my server.  If you want to take the time, Heavy Netherweave bandages sell for almost twice as much as the cloth alone, but it takes time to make them, so decide if its worth it (I didn't take the time).  There is a vendor in the camp you can sell everything at.  I usually get 6 Shadow Dust per run, so I have enough to turn in for an Elixir every time I head back to camp.\r\n\r\nYou will also get quite a lot of rep doing this too.  Every gray mob will give you 2 rep, not much, but the number you have to kill it adds up quickly.  The Talonsworn Forest-Rangers are still green and give 30 rep per kill.  The lesser bosses needed to summon Terokk give 100 rep per kill and Terokk gives a full blown 500.  The turn ins for the Elixir of Shadows gives 150 rep, and the turn in for the Time Lost Offering gives 350.

He'll put up his Immunity shield at roughly 50k health. Put the pet on passive, keep mend pet up, and lead him into the flames. Once his shield goes down, he'll Nuke your pet, there'll be nothing you can do about it, he hits very quickly for about 2k - 4k at a time (you might be able to try to get your pet away from him, haven't tried it myself). Now, DPS him as far as you can go, staying far away from him. Once his shield goes back up, put on cheetah and run around him in wide circles, trying to get him into some flames.

The spec is a hybrid pvp/pve frost, but it should work so long as you're spec'd into deep freeze.\n\nThe Buffs: \nInt/Ice armor\nFocus Magic (on Ele.)\nFort. (Runescroll)\nMark o' the wild/Kings (drums)\nFish Feast\n\nIce armor may not be needed, but I used it during most attempts in case I was struck. If it proves to be unnecessary in future fights, I'll likely sub Mage armor, for more shadowbolt resists (and thus, more mana return from absorbed spells)\n\nThe fight generally happens in three phases for my strategy.\n\nPhase 1: The Summoning - Water Ele. out (glyph'd for eternal). After summoning Terokk, I let Ele grab aggro with a few water bolts, and generally stand on the opposite side of the platform from them. I frostbolt a couple times, but let Ele maintain aggro until the first 'Chosen One' buff occurs. \n\nPhase 2: Chosen One - I pop Mirror Image and all cooldowns, and go all out. If you're lucky, you'll be able to burst him down to shield phase (Deep freeze helps with this considerably, putting out over 40k damage with the chosen one buff). \n\n-If this is not enough to get him to shield phase, you'll have to circle the platform, as you will now have aggro. Spam ice lance/instants when you can... you might get another chosen one buff during this time. The important thing is to circle WIDE... outside the banners. Terokk should NOT catch up to you, and any damage you take should be from shadowbolts. \n\nPhase 3: Shield Phase - Patience is key... you've got him where you want him, and he's even less likely to catch you now because of slowed movement. Continue to circle the platform, throwing an ice lance now and then so that he doesn't de-aggro and de-spawn (he WILL do this, so keep him in combat). Wait for an opportune moment to pass him through the fire, and make sure you're not too close when the shield comes down. Whittle him down with ice lance/instant-spam. If you're short on mana (and you very well could be at this point) patiently wait on your gem cooldown, or get a few seconds of evocate in when he stops to cast his shadowbolts... but keep circling! If he's moving, you're moving. \n\n- IF at any point he comes close enough to hit you, either ice block so he chases your ele, or blink away (carefully, so you actually blink forward) and continue your extra-wide circle.\n\nEdit: Finally got my trinket!

I promise you that with that spec you will be able to solo almost anything that does not have an enrage timer or crazy imba tactics even up to 5man 80lvl dungeons (and ofc 5-man Grp quests).\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/talent#Icxrbh0AoVZbGfhkAdVcs:swjz0M", "date": "2010-04-20T16:12:18-05:00", "rating": 3, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2010-04-20T16:42:41-05:00", 1, "Deathcaster"]}

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 94, "id": 2024581, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "scharky", "body": "Hey guys and girls, stay positive! Here are some tips for obtaining this wonderful unique item, and some advice for keeping your sanity during this long grind:\r\n\r\n1) Put on some great music, or your favorite TV shows/movies. All the seasons of The Simpsons comes to mind, perhaps Das Boot, or all the seasons of Law & Order. Don't be afraid to start them over from the beginning if you need to!\r\n\r\n2) Bring a friend or two--or three! Perhaps you know some folks with chronic insomnia, Asperger's, or OCD. Don't let those conditions go to waste--capitalize on them. If that fails, bribe them silly.\r\n\r\n3) Keep in mind that area looting saves lots of time these days. So keep your chin up--now you can obtain this item and only get one ulcer instead of three or four!\r\n\r\n4) Grinding can be frustrating, so don't keep those negative emotions bottled up. Let them out so everyone else can benefit from your rage. Shriek out obscene tirades at your guildies, your Bnet friends, your fellow wowhead users, your dog or goldfish, and even random people using /yell. After all, penning in those harmful feelings is self-destructive.\r\n\r\n5) Let those sneaky rogues, druids, and hunters know exactly how you feel about them. Everyone knows that these classes are played by subhuman beings devoid of any feelings or conscience (especially those players from Other Realms), so where's the harm in treating them like dirt? Call them hurtful names, hurl insults about their sexual lifestyle choices, make sweeping generalizations about the attractiveness of their significant others, and generally bombard them with every irritating behavior known to wow. Don't feel guilty--they know their behavior warrants it. Do not let them get away with it! Show them who's boss. Prove to those losers who the real champion of Terokkar Forest is.\r\n\r\n6) So you've waited and waited for the main boss's bone pile to spawn, then waited some more because other players have the audacity to go BEFORE you? You've spent long hours grinding for this moment--you deserve better. Hop on the wow forums and give those rotten, heartless, unfeeling devs a piece of your mind. Be certain to use an alt's name instead of your main, lest someone recognize you and flame you out of pure jealousy for your superior diction and incisive insights. Including loads of curse words and scathing vows to quit wow forever is the best method of grabbing their attention. Remember, the squeaky wheel gets the grease!\r\n\r\n7) Of chief importance--keep grinding for this item until you've lost all faith in yourself, MMOs, guildies, friends, other players, and life itself. What are those minor things compared to an item which transforms you into a hulking, limping bird monster? After all, this is the defining item in every truly great player's toybox. Without it, you are nothing. Your wow life will remain empty and meaningless until you obtain it. Guys will abuse and tease you, and girls will consider you the most pathetic loser in the game, until that magical moment when you finally secure the beloved, highly coveted Time-Lost Figurine that every single wow player drools over. Don't let the abuse and low self-esteem destroy you; don't let anyone dissuade you from your goal; disbelieve anyone who claims that earning this item isn't the utter pinnacle of warcraft omgness. Get this item at all costs.\r\n\r\nAnd above all....have FUN!", "date": "2014-11-05T01:50:01-06:00", "rating": -9, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

Thankfully Rank two Nature Resist (plus NE racial = 64 NR) plus Improved Mend Pet kept that poison from being deadly.  Between all this I was running my Steady Shot/Auto Shot weave.  However, it hits incredibly hard, and at about 40% going absolutely all out, I finally pulled aggro from my Ravager, which is what I wanted.  I had Mend Pet tick while the giant Spider beat on me for a bit, getting my pet back to about 60% then FD (which is where luck came in that it wasn't resisted).  From there, kept Scorpid Sting up, kept shot weaving and Mend Pet.  Ran completely dry of mana just as the thing went down.
