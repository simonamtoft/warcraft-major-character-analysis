Provided you have some pots, or some kind of trick up your sleeve regarding rapid Mana regeneration, then yes, this could be a good idea, but when he says it costs him his entire mana pool, he means what's left of it. so, depending on how low Gruul's health is, and how much longer you will need to heal, this could be a good idea, or a bad idea, and one's ability to use it in no way reflects on how well they have been healing. If you think its a good idea to give the main tank a 30% armour boost for 2 minutes at the expense of a valuable healer is a good idea, be my guest, but i don't think so, as it leaves the Paladin completely drained of mana, meaning he can not heal unless he pots, or, in some way, perhaps that druid spell, dont recall the name, he becomes worthless, and that could potententially end up having an undesirable effect on the MT, leading him to die.
