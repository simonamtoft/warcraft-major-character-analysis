That impacts Anub'berak in two ways.\n\nFirst,  we do the great things, but in reality it will go to some major lore character.\n\nLook at Warcraft I.  We play some no-name given orc commander who decides to take power.  Warcraft II gives us, the players actions, to Ogrim Doomhammer.\n\nIt isn't some lame arse xxxAirConditionxxx, EmoKillaPrime or Jiangalt who reveals Onyxia's identity or what not.  It now was King Wrynn.  There are exceptions, though.  As characters we are the new legends, thew next Uthers, the next Groms, in general.  \n\nIn Warcraft lore it won't be WristSlasha the Forsaken Rogue who did all those Brill quests and ended up downing Kel'Thuzard, but Johan Llane (or something) the Forsaken Rogue.\n\nSo it isn't five scrubs who kill him.  It is five heroes who won't receive a name till Warcraft 4, if ever.\n\nSecond, note what Anub'berak is doing besides a loot pinata.  He is leading the assault into Azjol'nerub.  He is holding a commanding position over half a zone (only a small part of it we play in).  There is only one major member of the Scourge deeper down than he is.\n\nAN/OK are two parts of a zone that spans a good chunk of Northrend.  A zone that probably should have been its own raid.\n\nIn story and function, Anub'berak is on equal grounds as Kel'thuzard is in invading the Dragonblight.  If anything even higher ground than KT, Anub'berak is leading and has taken half an entire ZONE as part of a five man before we kill him.\n\nKT, killed once already, can't even take a single Alliance town with Naxxaramas.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd as of 3.2, not only was Anub'berak leading an invasion and conquored half a zone, but roze from the dead (again), apparently took over more of it, snuck under the Argent Crusade's head quarters and training area to assult the Lich King and then opens a hole in the bottom of the recently constructed coliseum as part of the final raid boss for that raid.\n\nAnd with Naxxaramas, Kel'Thuzard, the twice Raid Boss, can't defeat a small chapel (In Vanilla) and then two small towns (in Wrath).\n\nNot bad for a \"leveling\" instance boss.

I used Mage Armor for this fight for several reasons - you resist his nasty debuff (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=52583) once in a while and it is the only way to not go oom with my gear. Used the NPC druid as a healer, don't forget to buff him with AI for a couple extra heals. So, I buffed myself (no dampen or amplify), Barrier up, popped IV and a trinket, summoned WE and unloaded on him. Did not renew the Barrier, because the NPC is a good healer and to conserve mana. I used my IB when the first debuff hit me, Cold Snap, Icy Veins + Trinket, WE again. Used 1 Mana Gem. When the NPC went oom, I summoned my Mirror Images, IB to clear the debuff, Evocated to full health and mana. This is the point where I used Ice Barrier again to tank some dmg, then, when I was really low, I found out he was kiteable at this point (he runs slower than you) and finished his last 20k hp with instants. Didn't even bother with the little blobs he summons.

Ursol did not show the second time around, and Tur Ragepaw despawned as soon as Ursoc went down.\n\n(Edit: Also probably worthwhile to note: I originally thought that those Blood of the Old Gods were a mechanic similar to Jedoga Shadowseeker in Ahn'kahet: The Old Kingdom, and would KoS them.
