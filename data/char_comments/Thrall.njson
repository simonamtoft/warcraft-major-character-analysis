In an unsurprising landslide victory, [b]Thrall was confirmed as leader of the Horde faction by capturing 69.7% of the vote.[/b] The bitter race on Alliance side led to a down-to-the-wire victory for Dwarven King Magni Bronzebeard who pulled in 24.9% of the vote. A distraught High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind, who received 24.5% was denied a recount in the Wetlands. [b]It is time for the final election for Supreme Leader of Azeroth.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Warchief Thrall[/b]\r\nThrall hopes that his political momentum will keep up through the general election.  Thrall promises to consider the needs of all races in Azeroth in his official decisions. His primary goal is to unite the civilized people in hopes that someday there will be peace across the lands. Other Planks in Thrall's platform include [u]balance[/u], [u]buffs for Shaman[/u], and strong foreign relations with the sovereign people of Outland. The Warchief's bid for Leadership in Azeroth has been officially endorsed by Rexxar and High Chieftan Cairne Bloodhoof.\r\n\r\n[b]King Magni Bronzebeard[/b]\r\nBronzebeard, fatigued from a difficult primary season, remains the family values candidate. He is in favor of exploring Azeroth and would prefer to relations with Outland to a minimum. Bronzebeard has been recently quoted as saying \"Feel the fury of the mountain!\" The king's promise to recover Gnomeregan has won his campaign the support of High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque.\r\n\r\n[b]Lady Jaina Proudmoore[/b]\r\nThis powerful sorceress has recently announced her independent candidacy for Leader of Azeroth due to the astounding amount of support she received as a write-in candidate in the Alliance faction race. Proudmoore has shown remarkable leadership skills in the foundation of Theramore, and is one of the last surviving heirs to the founders of the Alliance. Former Alliance candidates Highlord Bolvar Fordragon and High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind have pledged their support for the Proudmoore Campaign.\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAs promised, we now announce the Supreme Leader of Azeroth. [b]And the Winner is- Thrall![/b] Thrall carried a lead throughout the election and ended the race with 55.3 percent of the both, more than either of the Alliance candidates combined. Lady Jaina Proudmore finished the race in second place with 34.3 percent of the vote. King Magni Bronzebeard was disappointed in his 10.4% share of the vote, and has promised a better showing in future elections.\r\n\r\nRead more:\r\nhttp://www.wowinsider.com/2008/04/01/all-hail-thrall-supreme-leader-of-azeroth/", "date": "2008-04-24T16:23:40-05:00", "rating": 38, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "thats 100.2%... i think some people voted twice", "creationdate": "2009-08-02T03:53:05-05:00", "id": 113243, "rating": 8, "commentid": 276913, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "435294", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "lets do some basic math here...55.3 + 34.3 = 89.6, and 89.6 + 10.4 = 100.... not 100.2", "creationdate": "2009-08-31T23:09:43-05:00", "id": 422994, "rating": 1, "commentid": 276913, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "330982", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "probably two headed ogres", "creationdate": "2010-10-03T16:29:24-05:00", "id": 184899, "rating": 5, "commentid": 276913, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 256, "username": "vindurza", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}, {"body": "I think you need to recount toastermonster... it equals 100%.", "creationdate": "2010-12-16T05:44:37-06:00", "id": 204347, "rating": 2, "commentid": 276913, "dataTree": 1, "roles": 0, "username": "734863", "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "downvotedByUser": false, "reportedByUser": false, "votedByUser": false}], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

He has fought to try and \"free\" the orcs from the demons enslavement, but infact the corruption fed to the orcs preyed on their emotions. The orcs became monsters who butchered not because they were whiped and forced to by demon masters, but because they tasted chaos [i]and liked it[/i]. Essentially the corruption was a drug for them, the demons gave them the \"drug\" and they had no intention (at the time) of being freed from it.\r\n\r\nSkipping ahead WoW years, the orcs beleive they were freed when Mannoroth died. The assumption was that after Mannoroth died they were free from the demons corruption. Again, they were never imprisoned in the first place. In truth, the only purpose to Mannoroths death was that he was a source of the corruption, and simply put, the orcs killed their dealer. This means that Mannoroth cannot be used to corrupt new orcs or strengthen the corruption in green orcs, [b]but Magtheridon and other pit lords can be[/b].\r\n\r\nAlso, some people beleive he is fighting to ensure peace with the Alliance. In his own mind, this might be true, but as a whole this wont ever happen with the horde. The horde has made \"necessary evils\" time and time again, such as the bloodelves using demonic energy, the inclusion of undead in the horde and their expirements, and ofcourse the appointment of Garrosh. Most importantly is [b]you[/b], meaning the player base, most of you will think Thrall wants peace with the alliance and after reading this will flip on WoW, join a battleground and kill Alliance forces. Seems self explanatory to me thrall may want peace, but [b]you[/b] are still bloodthirsty hordies.\r\n\r\nTruth is I think his peace-with-Alliance attitude is a propaganda attempt by Blizzard to get more horde players. People will start looking at various Alliance characters and lore, think they're evil and reroll to horde. Other propaganda can include Saurfangs power, the tauren chieftains band, and I suppose the bloodelves to a lesser extent.", "date": "2009-04-16T23:12:11-05:00", "rating": -1, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}
