Eye of C'thun will periodically zap people with his green laser. When you get hit, it can chain to another person if he's closer than 10yd, and it can chain to yet another person from there and so on. For each person in the chain that gets hit, the amount of damage dealt is doubled. The first and second people in the chain have a fairly good chance to survive this, but 3rd and further are very likely to die. \nIn each sector, one melee player is going to focus on eye tentacles . If there's 2 melee chars in a group, the 2nd (warrior preferred) goes meleeing the eye.\nRanged DPS stands about in the middle of the sector, at appropriate distance from the eye tentacle spawn spots. Healers are at the outer border.\nTIP: Get the C'Thun Warner mod, it'll tell you if anyone else in the raid is at closer than 10yd to you. \nWhen he starts his Dark Glare (43750-56250 Shadow damage on any player)the whole raid must move clockwise or counter clockwise to avoid it.\nIn phase two positioning is the same as phase 1 in case a giant eye tentacle will spawn and in case a giant claw tentacle will spawn feel free to stay close to eachother.When sucked in the stomach of C'thun- kill the tentacles inside if you are a damage dealer , if you are a healer keep the damage dealer alive or get out if there is none inside.Be sure to time the stomach tentacles so that you kill them after all the giant tentacles outside are killed.", "date": "2006-12-10T03:25:26-06:00", "rating": 197, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Healers and damage dealers need to watch out when inside the stomach, since the stomach acid in which you will be (untill you jump to a \" dry \" spot in the stomach) will stack up debuffs which at about 8/9 will become dangerous to your HP.

Phase I\n\n                * Entering Cthuns Room\n                  The first person to enter Cthuns room will be struck by the Green Beam. If any raid members are too close it will chain and kill very rapidly since it doubles in damage. The raid will be split with groups 1-4 on the left and groups 5-8 on the right of the wall entrance. Groups 5-8 must be carefull to huge the far wall when moving into initial position.\n\n                  All players should be mounted.\n\n                  Once everyone is in the initial position, a MT will be shielded and go in first while he is mounted and get as close to the Eye of Cthun as possible. Once the MT is about half way in the other groups can move in. The groups should move in an order such that the furthest groups go first. So groups 4,5 then 3,6, then 2,7, finally 1,8.\n\n                  When moving in be sure NOT to get to close to the MT. As you move in and get to your positions be sure to move to the far back of your area to ensure you are not too close to others as they are coming in or going by.\n                * Phase 1\n\n                  Green Beam phase\n                  Once everyone is in the room they need to spread out in their respective area's with the rouge's in the groups in Melee range. The Warriors at the edge of the dark area (Eye Spawn points), but not right on it (knockback). Next Pallies/Mages/Locks. Finally, Hunters and Priests toward the back of thier designated area.\n\n                  Once everyone is in position DPS starts. All DPS on CThun. Priests, Druids doing DoT's or ranged. Pallies healing.\n\n                  Every 45 Seconds the Eye Tentacles appear, all DPS must switch to these. Pallies/Rouges stunning. Remember to keep distance since the Green Beam is still active. If a claw tentacle spawns the Pallies need to Stun quickly and that area's MT needs to get on the Tentacle quickly. All DPS in that area should switch to the claw.\n\n                  Red Beam phase\n                  Once the Red Beam Starts all groups should move to their opposite sides away from the beam.

Every [b]30 seconds[/b], 8 Little Eyes would spawn around C'Thun, and mindflay the raid (if left alive long enough they would kill the healers).   On another timer, every [b]40 seconds[/b], C'thun would spawn a Giant Claw and Giant Eye.  The Giant Claws would do about 1.5k-2k (which was a lot pre-BC) on t2 geared tanks and could use [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=3391]Thrash[/url] and kill a bunch of DPS or Healers at once.  The Giant Eyes had a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=26134]Green Beam[/url] effect that could chain to multiple targets and could kill your entire raid essentially.\nWhen entering Phase 2, C'Thun has 100% HP and now has a protective shield that basically nullifies any incoming attacks to do basically no damage.  To damage/kill C'Thun, he would \"eat\" people every 10 seconds and place them in him stomach.  In his stomach are two [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=15802]Flash Tentacles[/url] which have [b]24k hp[/b].  Your raid needs to kill both Flash Tentacles to weaken C'Thun.  After the nerf (not sure of how many before) it would take 2-3 weakenings to kill C'Thun.\n\nGiven the information above, it required guilds in T2/AQ40 gear (Naxx wasn't out yet, even though the gear wouldn't have been significant enough to kill him still) to put out a whopping [b]230k damage[/b] to keep up with the various spawns.  Now, this was possible for guilds back then, but only on single targets.  When you have 8, 12, 17, 22, or more adds alive (the spawns had no cap limit, you could technically have a full room of tentacles) its very hard to push out 230k damage for your always having to switch.\n\n[b]Patch 1.10.1 (hotfix)[/b]\nWe have also hotfixed the following changes to the C\u2019thun encounter in Ahn\u2019Qiraj:\n\n#Lowered the hit points of both Giant Claw Tentacles and Giant Eye Tentacles.\n#Decreased the damage caused by Ground Rupture, and made the effect resistable.\n#Significantly decreased the melee damage done by Giant Eye Tentacles.\n\nIn the 1.10.1 patch, we also changed the way that C\u2019thun identifies who is in his stomach. The faction changing debuff that was previously applied will no longer appear, but C\u2019thun\u2019s tentacles should not spawn in the stomach, nor should a player in the stomach be the target of C\u2019thun\u2019s Eye Beam.\n\nThe combination of these changes should give players more time to damage C'thun instead of dealing with tentacles, and see fewer \"unavoidable, random\" deaths occur due to Ground Rupture effects.\n\n[b]Patch 1.10.0[/b]\nTemple of Ahn'Qiraj\n# Removed the stacking acid from the Flesh Tentacles in the C'thun encounter.\n# Digestive Acid now increases its effect over time during the C'thun encounter.\n# Fixed a bug that could allow for the Digestive Acid debuff to be removed.\n# Lowered the amount of knockback dealt by Giant Tentacles.\n# Tentacles should no longer spawn on players who have just been knocked back by a previous tentacle.\n\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYkqw6BjPcw]Death and Taxes Pre-Nerf C'Thun Attempt[/url], Phase 2 transition is at 7:15", "date": "2008-10-25T12:13:30-05:00", "rating": 106, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2008-10-25T12:46:35-05:00", 2, "Siralex"]}

The most important thing to remember during phase one is to remain spread out -- everyone must be at least 15 meters apart.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is that the Eye of C'Thun's primary attack is a green laser beam, which is a direct Nature-based damage attack that randomly hits a member of your raid. This normally does somewhere around 2500 damage, which is always survivable at full health. However, if anyone is within 15 meters of the victim, the beam will jump to that player and doubles in damage. The beam will continue to chain to other nearby players, doubling in damage each time. When three or more players are hit, it is always fatal. Regular Nature Protection Potions, while not completely necessary, are cheap and can absorb much of the damage caused by a single-target eye beam.\r\n\r\nEvery minute and a half, the Eye charges up a deadly Dark Glare, which starts in one end of the room and makes a 180-degree sweep either clockwise or counterclockwise around the room, always ending on the opposite side of the room from where it started. The Dark Glare is fatal to anyone who touches it, so they must get out of the way as it approaches them. Mages can actually Blink through the Dark Glare if they are willing to take the risk. Groups will be on opposite sides of the room when the Dark Glare ends. During this period, your raid does not need to hold to the 15-meter rule.\r\n\r\nEvery 45 seconds, eight Eye Tentacles spawn around C'Thun. It is your raid's priority to kill these as quickly as possible, as they cast a Mindflay that will kill people if not taken down fast enough. The tentacles can be stunned, interrupted, counterspelled, pummeled, shield bashed, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Eye of C'Thun has over 1 million HP, but the difficulty of the encounter really comes from how well your raid can react to the absolute chaos going on around them. Keep in mind that the Eye of C'Thun has no aggro properties, so your raid is free to unload as much DPS as possible without having to worry about pulling aggro.\r\n\r\nOverall, once your raid group learns the positioning and movement required to stay alive, the Eye of C'Thun isn't terribly difficult to defeat.
