They are camping one spawn point each. Rogues and Warriors of each team stand right in the gate to the cave where the Drakonids spawn. Via /assist they focus all damage on one after another and kill them as fast as they spawn. The warriors in the teams will mainly use cleave/retaliation/sweeping strike/whirlwind whenever available to get as much aggro on them as possible. Mages/Warlocks keep the are under constandt blizzard/fire rain. No more than 4 drakonids should be alive at one time. Those who get shadowbolted by Nefarian during this phase have to be healed quickly. Usually Nefarius pesters the team at the spawn point near the room entrance. \r\n\r\n(we usually have 3 warriors on each side) \r\n\r\n(in case of red drakonids warlock AoE has no effect on them, so we have mages in one team, warlocks in the other) \r\n\r\nPHASE II \r\n\r\n3 Priests and 3 Druids together with MT1 (fearwarded) go grab Nefarian and position him correctly while the rest of the raid kills the remaining Drakonids (spawns stop when Nefarian lands) \r\n\r\nFrom here on its a straight forward fight. Every now and then a AoE fear and a class shout. \r\n\r\nWarlock: as soon as the infernals spawn they have to be killed ASAP to prevent them from going rogue on casters. \r\n\r\nPriests: the moment the shout goes off, all priests have to immediately cancel their channeled heal, sit there and do nothing until the debuff wears out. If a heal lands, the targetted player gets a stacking DoT DoT each time a heal lands. Renew and shield can still be cast. \r\n\r\nDruid: the druid shout doest do anything bad to druids, they are just stuck in cat. However this naturally takes away a lot of healing. \r\n\r\nAt all times, especially just before a fear, the MT should have a full set of HoTs on him to bridge the heal-less time. \r\n\r\nLast but not least the rogue shout: This one just ports the rogues in front of Nefarian in a stun lock. If they get hit by Nefarian's Shadowflame or a couple of cleaves they die. To counter this, Nefarian is always positioned at an angle (see illustration) and in case of a rogue call immediately turned to the alternate position. \r\n\r\nLast but not least nefarian casts a -70% healing curse on the MT. Has to be dispelled immediately (druids job). \r\n\r\nMages: Since the mage class call can mess up the tanking and healing quite severely if not dispelled asap, we keep mages in a position without LoS to the MT and Healers (see illustration) \r\n\r\nPHASE III \r\n\r\nThe Drakonids we killed before rise back to life in the exact spot they were killed before. At 22% all mages and warlocks get in position near the spawn points to kill off the bone constructs immediately with AoE. A hunter sets up a frost trap in the middle of the bone pile on each side to slow the initial movement of the spawns. \r\n\r\nMages keep the spawns in nova-lock (using a limited invulnerability potions to get away). Ideally the mobs are all locked down until they are dead. As soon as the first mobs are immobilized Fire Rains and Blizzards are used to kill. \r\n\r\nOnce the main packs are dead, the spawns that managed to escape are killed and the fight resusmes as normal for the last 20%!", "date": "2006-12-09T13:31:23-06:00", "rating": 61, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

[i]I kept the old post for historical purposes, in spoiler tags.[/i]\n\n[spoiler]If you do not have the [item=15138] you can manage this event with a minimum of 1 tank and 2 healers (+some dps, the more the faster/easier for healers). The shadow flame ticks around 1k dmg -no problem what so ever but at the end at the debuff it deals [b]16k damage[/b]! This means the tank needs to be on full health (at least over 16k hp) before debuff runs out! (And the only one standing in-front getting the shadowflames) Just have the tank capped off and its easy to survive. The more dps you bring along, the less healing you have to do as well!\n\n[b]To survive the transaction phase 1 -> phase 2, simply have everyone behind the throne.[/b] When you see Nefarious yell, wait 10 sec and rush out to pick him up, face him away from the raid asap! The last phase when all mobs you killed in phase 1 spawn is easy to kill, they hit for nothing really.

This scarcity of scales is because Upper Blackrock Spire's black dragons were removed, and most remaining dragons in Azeroth have had their levels altered so that they no can longer drop scales adequately.\n\nThe pets in this raid are also good for collecting, pet battles, and selling.\n\nLastly, Nefarian drops some incredible recipes, and not too uncommonly either. I have had a huge variety of these loot-list items drop, and they are even more difficult to come by in the world anymore because of aforementioned level scaling. He can also drop [item=1973], which have upped in value since they became a toy.\n\nHere is a list of recipes he has personally dropped [i][b]at least[/b][/i] once for me:\n\n[ul]\n[li][item=12720][/li]\n[li][item=14510][/li]\n[li][item=14497][/li]\n[li][item=14507][/li]\n[li][item=14501][/li]\n[li][item=12716]*** from mobs in BWL[/li]\n[li][item=7976]*** This is arguably the least valuable, most common plan Nefarian drops[/li]\n[li][item=8028][/li]\n[li][item=11226][/li]\n[li][item=12692][/li]\n[li][item=13518]*** A guildie friend found this from him[/li]\n[li][item=13488][/li]\n[li][item=13487][/li]\n[li][item=16055][/li]\n[li][item=16044][/li]\n[li][item=15742][/li]\n[/ul] \n\n[s]The biggest issue I've seen people have is getting past the first boss. It definitely is a strategy one needs to get accustomed to. Here are my tips for soloing:\n\n1.) Grab the orb to start, take out all the eggs and make your way slowly to your character\n2.) When you get a dragonkin on you, lull it to sleep with spell \"5\"\n3.) Let go of the boss with escape or the red arrow and AoE the mobs around you. And depending on your character, throw a HoT on yourself. That will help aggro stay on you\n4.) Don't let go of Razorgore near the end. The aggro shift won't do much after you've gotten to a certain point\n5.) [b]DO NOT[/b] attack him until he heals himself. If you do, he will reset and kill everybody.[/s]\n\n[i]EDIT: Razorgore has been made pretty much wipe proof. His egg destroy spell no longer has a cooldown. Just wait about 2 seconds before killing him after all the eggs are destroyed.\n[/i]\nI hope this helps.

{"commentv2": 1, "number": 7, "id": 1250962, "nreplies": 14, "sticky": 0, "user": "Nethris", "body": "There actually havent been any tactics regarding this boss so far, so heres..\n\nHow to: Nefarian (Normal)\n\nBoss is split in to 3 phases, p1 with nefa/ony, p2 with magma/nefa flying/adds and p3 with nefa/fire.\n\n(Note for 10man: You absolutely NEED 3 healers, unless you have extremely good self heals combined with some luck in phase 2, as you can not reach from one platform to another. And the boss does stupid amounts of aoe damage anyways.)\n\nPhase 1\n\nFight starts with pulling ony, and the idea here is to nuke nefa as close to 71% as possible but not to 70% and then kill ony.\nOne tank pull ony to one side of the room, bosses side facing the raid (To make this more clear, look at the minimap. For example, tank ony at the east side of the circle, with her head being south and tail at north. Nefarian on the other side, same thing). Ony does tail lash behind her (~40k physical dmg to clothies, ~50y range), breath in front of her and lightning to her sides (can not be outranged). Nefa has same breath/tail lash, but no lightning to sides. \nDuring phase 1, adds spawn which periodically stack a buff on themselves increasing phys dmg and movement speed, simply cc the adds (fear/trap/root/shackle/whatever) but make sure you do not cc them in front of the bosses breath, as the breath frees them from cc and gives them max energy again. Once the mob runs out of energy, itll die until phase 3.\n\nAs mentioned above, tank ony with her side facing the raid. When lightning sparks start forming around ony, turn onys tail towards raid to avoid massive aoe damage. When it ends, turn it back again. \n\nAs for dps, melee can go straight for nefa when he lands (unless you are very melee heavy), rest of the dps get ony down to around 10-15% (tank can whittle her down) then move to nefa. The thing about dps'ing nefa is that everytime you take 10% of his health off, he does a ridiculous aoe nuke to everyone in the raid, which is unavoidable (hits for ~105k before resists). Make sure you use nature res aura/totem, def cooldowns and be topped off before it hits (the boss will emote as well). After 2 electrocutes and nefa at ~71-74%, kill ony to trigger p2.\n\nEdit: If you feel like you are wiping due to staying in P3 too long, do this. Get ony VERY close to death (<100k), get nefa to 70% to trigger the third electrocute then IMMEDIATELY kill ony. The third electrocute will hit approximately as nefa starts moving towards the middle of the room to start phase 2 and you should have enough time to heal the raid up to not die to the lava (pop tranquility/hymn/even more cooldowns if need be). This way you can move one electrocute from p2/p3 off and nuke nefa more in p2.\n\nPhase 2\n\nNefa flies to air and the platform sinks in to magma. Split the raid in to 3 evenly and jump on the pillars and IMMEDIATELY start interrupting the adds spawned on the pillars. Melee nuke down the adds on pillars, ranged nuke either nefa or the adds, depending whether you want to nuke nefa down more during p2 and eating another electrocute (remember, ~100k aoe on top of already nefa spamming random aoe). Nefa himself will simply spam random shadow bolt thingies which have a tiny aoe upon landing, so spread on top of the pillar to minimize damage (Needs confirming, not 100% sure about whether they have aoe at all). Phase 2 ends when the last add dies.\n (If you didnt nuke nefa during p2, he will still be at ~71% hp, otherwise, you could theoretically even kill him in phase 2 if you can just eat all the aoe thrown at you while keeping at least one add alive. Dont know if theres an enrage timer or anything or if he comes down at some point regardless of adds, but if he does, its a very forgiving timer)\n\nPhase 3\n\nNefa has the same abilities as in p1 and one additional ability which will resurrect the adds in phase 1 back. The new ability will spread fire on the ground, which will reignite the adds from p1 back. The idea is to have one tank, one dps who can snare (frost mages are the #1 for this) and one heal kite all the adds around  while attempting to keep them out of fire to have them deactivate for a little while, resetting their stacks of their self buff (The snaring DPS doesnt have to help the tank 24/7. Warrior tanks can do it by themselves with Piercing Howl). Pay attention to the flying meteors which indicate where the fire will land, move accordingly and reset the mobs as much as possible (Unless your DPS is very good or you took nefa down close to ~50% already during phase 2, you HAVE to reset their stacks or they will mow down your raid at some point.)\n\nThe rest of the raid nuke nefa, tank him in the middle of the room, watch out for tail lash/breath (still reignites adds!), move out of fire if needed and remember, for every 10% nuked, 100k aoe to everyone. If/When fire spreads to the middle, move accordingly, but make sure you dont have nefa breathing at the adds.\nAs long as you have either very good dps or your add group kites successfully, nefa will go down eventually.\n\nHonestly, in my opinion, this fight is an example of bad mechanics from blizzard. Being the \"final\" first tier boss (not counting sinestra), the boss mainly rotates around incredibly amounts of aoe damage at set intervals. Its like they ran out of ideas how to make the boss hard and just went with the \"Damn, how do we make this boss harder? I know, lets add in seemingly random ~100k aoe nukes to the whole raid!

What seemed to work best for me, was to do 2 blood strikes on Onyxia right at the start, then swap over to blood presence.  Do this to have 2 blood runes pop up when the adds start coming - it is very helpful.  Then I would have our hunter MD the first add to me, Death and Decay the second add, Outbreak the third add, and howling blast the 4-6th adds.\r\n\r\nYou will eventually get a feel for it, and it can be very effective to let healers aggro some of the skeletons with healing aggro while non-slowed skeletons are running towards you from the MD / DnD / Outbreak, and hit multiple skeletons with Howling blast at once, as well as be able to get some distance.  Once you have 2 or so howling blasts worth of aggro on all skeletons, you can swap to Unholy presence for the additional run speed.\r\n\r\nAt this point, circle around then and group them up as tight as possible, and then right as the first skeleton dies, go in to the pack of them and use hungering cold.  This will freeze them in place long enough for 3 more to die, and it least the last two with 4% and ~12% energy.  Chains of ice root them both, and all the skeletons should die in a nice small clump, making it very easy for your add tank in Phase 3.

My job was to look after any that spawned in the north whilst the mage took the adds spawning in the south, I repentanced one and turn eviled the other (usually only had 2 to worry about) and after that we chain cc'd them down, kiting them in tight circles when CC broke to ensure they all died on one spot. The mage took the aggro, while I was ready with a Hand of Protection for him, as well as some heals. If I had to HoP him, I immediately applied Righteous Fury and dropped a Consecration and Divine Storm, with taunt ready for any loose adds. While not a conventional kiting combination, it worked very well for our raid group as I am currently threat capped when dpsing so was more useful kiting than auto-attacking Nef or Ony.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 - Anyone with bubble, iceblock, cloak of shadows and so on, save your damage reduction or cancellation spells/techniques for phase 2 if they are on a cool down of greater than 2 mins. Depending on whether or not your group is doing 1 or 2 electrocute during phase 2, either get everyone use the cooldowns at once for 1 electrocute or alternate who is using their cooldown if you have the dps to do a 2nd.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 and 2 are not dps races as such, ensure you will have all your best DPS increasing cooldowns for phase 3.\r\n\r\nFor cooldown use throughout the fight, if you've got a priest aoe bubble on the ground or a paladin's Divine Guardian during an electrocute and you are covered by it, don't waste a personal cooldown, save it for the next electrocute.\r\n\r\nIf you are a dps class with healing spells, remember that a living dps doing lower dps does a lot more damage in a fight than a high dps dieing a preventable death! If you have a warlock get some Healthstones on the go. Paladins have LoH, both for themselves or a fellow raid member in need (try and time it so bubble is available for phase 2 though, usually LoH is only necessary during phase 3 as the damage in P1 is light). Mages can Evocate for health as well as mana. Have a health pot rather than a dps pot. Use bandages - this is best done just before an Electrocute in P1 or P3 as you can get around 5 ticks of a bandage channeled on yourself before any damage interrupts it.\r\n\r\nAll the various methods of healing mean that prior to an Electrocute, everyone should be topped up to the max, even if you have to OOM yourself (as Ret paladins may do with FoL) to survive the Electrocute damage, it's better to be alive and regenerating mana just after than licking the floor.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I had a more structured explanation planned, but my time has been cut short and I've got to go now! I hope some of this may have been beneficial, though tbh it's mostly common sense :)", "date": "2011-02-21T11:26:53-06:00", "rating": 19, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}}

The buff increases damage done by 5% * number of stacks for 18 seconds. [b]150 stacks increases damage done by 750% for 18 seconds.[/b]\n\nWhile dominated, players will move toward a portal, if the player reaches the portal they die instantly. Players may be slowed - earthbind totem, frost trap etc., so that they may stack the buff to higher levels before breaking the mind control.\n\n[b]NOTE 1[/b]: [s]as of this writing, you can use RP walk (default numpad /) before being dominated, resulting in a slow enough movement that you can easily stack the damage buff to 150.[/s] Has been fixed.\n\n[b]NOTE 2[/b]: if you are dominated during an electrocute, you will not take damage.\n\n[b]NOTE 3[/b]: it takes a second or so for the game to register raid-wide buffs (ie - resistance aura) when you release domination; if you release right as an electrocute happens, there is a good chance you will be 1 shot without the resistance.\n\n[b]NOTE 4[/b]: as the ability which breaks mind control will usually be bound to 1, you will want to avoid spamming abilities you normally have bound to 1 while Nef is casting domination.\n\nDue to the enrage timer on Nef, not stacking the buff is not an option. Healers may choose to stack the buff or not, [b]it does increase healing[/b], and, for example, with 150 stacked an efflorescence will full heal everyone standing in it every ~2 ticks.\n\n[code]Explosive Cinders - Phase 2[/code]\n\n[spell=79339]\n\nExplosive Cinders is randomly placed on several players (my only experience is 25 man, in which, iirc, 4 players get the debuff). When this debuff expires, the player will knockback anyone within ~10-12 yards (not certain of the exact range). Due to this, the player(s) with Explosive Cinders must jump off the platform into the lava, far enough way so they won't knock the remaining players on the platform off.\n\n[b]NOTE 1[/b]: when in the lava, do not jump. Every time you jump, you will gain an additional stack of Magma.\n\n[b]NOTE 2[/b]: this is cast several times during phase 2 (not sure of the interval between casts), and may be cast as the lava is residing - you still need to stay away from raid members if you have the debuff when the lava is down.\n\nThe knockback knocks back extremely far. We had people knocked to other platforms.\n\n[code]Additional Notes[/code]\n\n*Walking through fire in p3 while dominated will still cause the fire to grow; cancel MC if you're going to walk through fire.\n\n*The adds in p3 tend to have huge spike damage and, along with electrocute, will often be destroying your kiter. We had 3 (+1 on occasion) out of 7 healers dedicated to focusing on this tank. You will need to use Blessing of Sacrifice/Pain Suppression etc. when adds have recently been rez'd and many are hitting your tank.\n\n*We used a holy paladin with righteous fury to pull adds to the tank. Simply healed and ran slightly ahead of the kiter.\n\n*At current gear levels, you will not be able to push Nef to 70% before phase 2.\n\n*Phase 2 is by far the most difficult phase for healing, so you will not be able to push Nef to 70% (or whatever your next threshold electrocute is, assuming somehow you did get Nef below 70 p1) during this phase.\n\n*More than likely, if you need to use a healthstone, you'll use it phase 2.\n\n*All information was taken strictly from 25 man.\n\n*All raid members should use personal cooldowns for electrocute: Barkskin, Shield Wall, Feint, Raptor Strike (glyph) etc. as much as possible.\n\n*Acquiring [item=62466] for the electrocutes/having to stand in lava with Explosive Cinders is highly recommended.

From the start of phase 2 to end, nef can only take 15% worth of his health in damage, anything more and he auto pushes, regardless of chromatics or 2 and a half minute auto push (which btw, 3 min i believe applies to 10 man 25 ma seems to be 2:30 on normal, heroic seems to be more like 4 min, it's wierd but there are variations)\n\nSo basically, phase 2 ends if any of following happen.\n\n1. Nef takes 15% damage\n2. All 3 chromatics die on normal\n3. ANY of the chromatics die on heroic\n4. after set time (variable based on difficulty/size)\n\nThis is very important when doing the achievement in meta. It means that for him to actually go below 50% before phase 2 ends, he has to be below 65% when phase 2 starts. Since pushing him below 70% auto explodes onyxia 5 seconds later. the ideal strat is to push him below 70%, then, kill onyxia within the 5 seconds he's channeling electrocute, make sure she does 1-2 seconds before it goes off, so she doesn't explode, once she dies, phase 1 ends as soon as lava fills room, which means you have until then to get him to < 65%. this is easier then it sounds since he's already probably at 68 or 67 by end of electrocute cast, if you held off ony til last second, you only have another 2-3 percent to burn while he walks from hopefully close to wall, to center of room, then takes a couple seconds to lift off ground and fill room.\nThe achievement itself will turn red, indicating failure, it's WRONG. As long as he was below 65% when phase 2 started, you have not failed. To ensure success however, shoot to push him using number 1 above in my list. That is the way to know for sure you were successful. In other words, if phase 2 ends when he reaches 51% with chromatics up, you failed, because that means he was at 66% when phase 2 started, and 15% auto push ended the phase before achievement completed.

While I can't speak for every raid situation, I can say that, having just learned tonight how to kite these adds on my Frost DK (our Frost Mage wasn't available), there are some tips and tricks aimed at 10 mans that can't afford a third tank.\n\nObviously reading a strat isn't as a good as watching a video, but I don't have one of those for this fight. :(\n\nWhat I can say is that, if a Frost DK or any other class with similar ranged slows (mage, hunter, etc) is having trouble, here is what helped me.\n\n1) Remember, above all else, they (seem) to stack their haste and attack power buff by HITTING YOU. I know wowhead says they get a buff over time, but that is not what I saw. The first phase seems to be them hitting you. Therefore, it is imperative that you not let them hit you. Great ways to actually do this are to remember to refresh chillbains early on those mobs you picked up early as it will have worn off by the time the 5th and 6th add are up and getting ANY raid member with a stun (warrior, pally, etc) to stun them. Remember, speed debuff doesn't work if they hit you; they have to be STUNNED for you to get away.\n\n2) You cannot, unless you are uber pro, kite them by yourself. Our [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=49203]Hungering Cold[/url] is on too long a cooldown. Having stuns from pallys and warriors helps alot. You should save your own [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=49203]Hungering Cold[/url] and (hope that you have one) your mage's [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=82691]Ring of Frost[/url] for the final 30% of their energy.\n\nBasically, you do the following:\nDrop down, dps Ony for a few secs.\nSwitch to Blood Pres.\n[s]Howling Blast[/s] [i]Chains of Ice[/i] mobs as they come up.\n[s]If a mob is too close to you in comparison to the others, Chains of Ice it.[/s] as the mobs start to group up and their Chillbains from the Chains wear off, Howling Blast them.\nTry to run in a circle to gather the mobs behind you and then use any speed boost/leap of faith you have (I am a Worgen so, \"tee hee\") to get out in front of the pack in the direction you are supposed to drop them. If you don't have a speed boost or even if you do, this a perfect time for a Pally etc to stun them.\nOnce you are where you need to drop them, pop your Ice Bound Fortitude, run through the pack, and hit your Hungering Cold as soon as you are sure you will get them all (this needs to happen as soon as they touch you as you will die VERY fast if you try to tank them).\nWatch the timer and have your mage (cross fingers for a mage) drop their Ring of Frost with 3 seconds left, meaning that they get insta frozen again as they break out. \nOnce that wears off, simply tank the one or two who are still alive, making sure they drop right on top of the others (your phase three add tank will thank you).\nIf you don't have a mage, just stun them as soon as they break it/kite them in a tight circle and have healers use a cooldown. A few should die as your Hungering Cold breaks with more to follow. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nEdit: Not a PvP, so I never realized until I came back to kill him the next week that Chains of Ice does not have a cooldown. :P", "date": "2011-06-09T23:31:53-05:00", "rating": 4, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-06-27T12:46:37-05:00", 3, "ZelosRaine"]}

It is a lot less awareness based and more of an execution fight - but one mistake can become a wipe and it is very unforgiving.\n\nOur comp was a paladin main tank, warrior off tank.\nDPS were MM hunter, Assas rogue, Feral druid, Arcane mage, and Shadow priest. \nHealers were Holy paladin, Discipline priest, and Resto shaman, all with four piece.\n\nDominion was handled with AoE snares, such as frost trap, earthbind totem, and most importantly, crippling poision as crippling is a 70% snare and makes the entire difference.\n\nFirst phase was pretty simple, I vigilance our paladin healer with righteous fury, and pick up Onyxia, bringing her to the right side of the pit, positioning does not matter as long as both dragons are separated for their buff. Pick up each Bone Construct as the Onyxia tank, letting them hit the paladin a couple of times at the beginning is fine. I suggest not spreading rend. Each time Onyxia does her flame breath, Stun the Bone Constructs on each breath, glyphed it should be up each time. Everything else stays the same with Electrocutes from Onyxia's side hitting extremely hard.\nAt around 2 million HP, we AoE CC'd the constructs, in our case a Ring of Frost from our mage. Note that if your mage gets Dominioned and you step into the ring, you will get frozen and Onyxia will deselect you, often causing a wipe.\nAll the adds die about 5 seconds after Onyxia dying, so there are no worries about them during the second phase.\nWe did not push a crackle or touch Nefarian during phase 1.\n\nPhase 2 is also pretty simple, we split our raid with 4-3-3, with a back up healer on each platform. In our case, the shadow priest, feral druid, and prot paladin were on different platforms. Each platform should have a dedicated back up interrupter. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=68713]Mirror of Broken Images[/url] was absolutely amazing from this point. We used them for half our raid.\nWhen you get cinders, wait for the debuff to tick to about 4 seconds. Use the trinket, start swimming into the lava, and watch it explode (Although for the first couple of attempts I'd play it safe and start heading into the lava at about 6 seconds). The resistance on the trinket makes this mechanic much more easier to heal through, and is in our opinion much more valuable than mana regen or a couple hundred DPS, as DPS and mana was not an issue on our kill. We bloodlusted during this phase to make it end as soon as possible as it's definately the most healing intensive phase. Do note that you should have a good balance of DPS on each platform, once the first Chromatic Prototype dies, the lava starts sinking and anyone on a platform will take damage after the first dominion on phase 3.", "date": "2011-06-12T02:41:44-05:00", "rating": 17, "indent": 0, "roles": 0, "deleted": 0, "outofdate": 0, "userRating": 0, "replies": [], "dataTree": 1, "markupDisabledEnvironments": {"ptr": true, "beta": false}, "lastEdit": ["2011-06-12T03:29:08-05:00", 1, "Manbewbs"]}
{"commentv2": 1, "number": 36, "id": 1439693, "nreplies": 0, "sticky": 0, "user": "Manbewbs", "body": "Phase 3 will be the most demanding on your healer and tanks, the main tank must always prioritize movement on your off tank, as a tail swipe or a breath will cause unnecessary damage or adds resetting. The challenge of the main tank will be to move out of fire (the first fire almost always followed him) and to have a personal CD up for every single crackle, as we had to use all the external cooldowns on the add tank.\nUsing [url=http://www.wowhead.com/item=50361]Sindragosa's Flawless Fang[/url] and the BH trinket made me not need a large CD on every other one. You can use both trinkets at the same time, providing a whopping 50%+ personal CD for every other one.\n\nI suggest saving Shield block for each crackle too (It was up for every one) as specced into [url=http://www.wowhead.com/spell=84608]shield mastery[/url] it reduced the damage even more. If you're a paladin, I strongly suggest glyphing into Divine Protection as you are most likely going to die from either nefarian's breath or a crackle.\n\nEach crackle had a raid CD, and each tanks had a CD.\n90%: raid-rallying cry, tanks-trinkets/DP\n80%: raid-trinkets, tanks-Shield Wall/GoA\n70%: raid-power word:barrier, tanks-trinket/DP\n60%: raid-trinkets, tanks-Bubble Sac/Ardent\n50%: raid-divine guardian, tanks-trinket/DP\n40%: raid-trinkets, tanks-Shield Wall/LoH\n30%: raid-spirit link totem, tanks-trinket/DP\n20%: raid-rallying cry, tanks-Pain suppresion/GoA\n10%: raid-anything left over, tanks-anything left over.\n\nSo as you see we had to coordinate CD's, and some attempts because of RNG with DPS we didn't have a CD for the raid.\n\nWhen it comes to add tanking, the first Shadowblaze should re activate all of the adds, because if you were tanking them in phase 1, they would be in a neat pile around where Onyxia died. I strongly suggest letting the adds stay in the pile of shadowblaze, having their energy bars resetting for about 10 seconds, as done incorrectly and not letting them reset for 10 seconds, they will all die at the third shadowblaze, thus making them either scattered because you were kiting them away from the third one, or them dying and instantly respawning again. Giving them a 10 second period of wallowing in the fire will make them despawn after the third shadowblaze and give your healer a lot of breathing room before the fourth one, which will ideally reactivate them all.\n\nAfter each shadowblaze, the timers between them will become faster and faster until they're at a point where a shadowblaze will come in 10 second intervals(need a confirmation, as I'm not sure on that) but they will not spawn any faster.\n\nThe key to making sure that you don't run out of room towards the end, is to move at about 2 seconds left on the shadowblaze timer, and not at the 5 second mark, when DBM usually yells at you. After kiting them away from the shadowblaze, it's usually a good idea to immediately stun them, as long as you're about 10+yards away, to reduce damage taken as shockwave or holy wrath, as long as they all don't miss, is pretty much a 100% damage reduction from melee attacks.\n\nA thing to note about stunning though, is to NOT run before the stun duration falls off IF one of your stuns miss. Reason being is that if you panic and run away because you stunned them and a shadowblaze timer is incredibly close, there is a chance that the shadowblaze will spawn underneath the add that was not stunned, so while the adds that were stunned come out of the stun and start following you, the shadowblaze that was underneath the add that wasn't stunned probably spawned while they were running towards you, and will reset their energy and it's almost guaranteed it's a wipe, depending on how many stacks of the damage increase they had when they reset.\n\nWhen positioning the adds, keep your back towards the direction you are going to kite, and the adds making a fan shape in front of you. The reason for this, is that if you keep your back towards the edge of the pit, and the adds between you and Nefarian, they will try to get to the sides of you, so that they have room for themselves (a thing all mobs do if you're used to AoE tanking) and if a shadowblaze comes and you start running, the add is likely to be trying to get to the position where they were heading towards while they were funneling around you, and then start running towards you, becoming a likely reset of their energy bar. The most frustrating time when an add resets is when one or two of them do, and 3 of them don't. It makes it much more harder to pick them up and kite shadowblazes from then on unless you purposely reset them, obviously becoming more damage that the healers need to heal on you.\n\nPaladin healers are my favorite for this (<3 josh), they have a speed increase when they pop holy radiance, and strong single tank healing and strong output cooldowns such as Avenging Wrath, Guardian of Ancient Kings, and Divine Favor when the add buff starts getting into the 10's. They also have righteous fury for when the adds die scattered. When it comes to the positioning of the healer, have them in front of you, but closer to Nefarian than you (at about 7 o' clock) and try to have him always in the front of your kite path. Healing will get tougher and tougher the longer the adds are up, so he is going to stop to hard cast a lot more the farther you get into a set of adds and will start lagging behind, sometimes ending up at about 11 o' clock. When the adds finally die, this is the healer's que to start making distance again and to regen as much as possible, as a shadow blaze is going to come soon. Use dominion to your advantage, as after dominion wears off it will give you a run speed increase.\n\nIf you end up kiting too fast and reaching fire towards the end, it may be a good idea to wait and keeping the adds in the shadowflame for 2 shadowflames before you start kiting again, but I do not know if this will work as I have not tried it (theoretically it should).\n\nAlthough this is months behind, I hope it will help you and your raid get a better understanding of the fight.

Each crackle occurs at 10% past Nef's hp and does approx 60-70k raidwide aoe dmg. Tanks dps and healers should make sure they are topped up before pushing one. or be ready to use a survival Cooldown.\r\n\r\nPhase1. have the kiter pickup adds and run them away from nef/onyxia ( a frost DK is preferred because he can blast adds from afar and spec into chillblains for the fight so he never gets hit, being hit by an add will increase its dmg by 100% making you very likely to die. as a Dk kiter you will probly get zapp'd by onxia once or twice. be sure to pop AMS before that occurs and glyph it for 7 seconds. adds fall over in around 30 seconds so go back to ony after that.\r\n\r\nBurn Onyxia and ignore nef for the most part. Onyxia should be in the farthest right side of the room past the right pillar, and Nef on the far left one. This prevents the 2 dragons from enraging and killing everyone. The only concern with Phase1 for dps/healers should be staying clear of Onyxia's lighting attacks, this is the Onyxia tanks job. turn ony when she starts sparkling then turn her back. when in doubt, stay behind Onyxia, its far better than being zapped continously.\r\n\r\nPhase2. burn the add and interrupt it from casting blast nova, You must have 1 solid 10 second interrupter on each platform and atleast 1 healer on each as well. swimming across the lava may be done but its a very bad idea.\r\n\r\nPhase3: the Add tank will need to kite the bone warrior adds around as Nef is faced in a single direction. just tank n spank mainly till nef's dead.

If you have a pet tank then this fight is really easy, if not then you need to be either really hard to kill, have really high DPS to kill Nefarian before the [npc=41918] become problematic, or duo with a tank. Tanks can get a lot of vengeance here, so it might be worthwhile to swap to a tank spec if you have one. Warlocks and Hunters shine here, Warlocks can facetank the bone warriors and Hunters can kite them. Guardian Druids also look to be good enough due to [spell=106737]. If you have any form of remote taunt, then nothing else can threaten you. The better gear you have the easier it gets. Better gear lets you burn Onyxia faster, tank bone warriors longer, and/or kill Nefarian faster before the bone warriors become a threat due to [spell=79330].\n\nWhen you jump down to fight Onyxia, if you have a pet then [b]DO NOT[/b] land on the three platforms, the fight starts and your pet is stuck there. Anyway, she should die fast from your opener if you're a DPS, I can't comment for tanks because she died before any major mechanics happened. If you're ranged, as she dies, stand in between two platforms (think about the sides of a triangle), don't worry about the lava. Start shooting one of the three [npc=41948]s, and interrupt the other immediately as [spell=80735] is casted. Make your way to a platform, any platform, once the nova is interrupted. Phase 3 will start as soon as you kill one, and the lava will disappear, but the two other adds are still alive. Kill those, you don't need any more headache in the hardest part of the fight.\n\nPhase 3 is where it gets difficult. The [npc=41918]s hit for ~30k, which doesn't sound bad until you consider that there are several of them, and they eventually become untankable due to [spell=79330]. As to why pet tanking is so good here? [spell=77826] and [spell=81031] refreshes and reanimates the bone warriors, so if you can get a pet to face Nefarian away and move the bone warriors away from the fire, they die, good job. They will eventually get reanimated, it's not the end of the world, just repeat the process. He's not all that remarkable after that, dragon rules (stay to his side, not front or back) still applies, like it has always been for almost 10 years. He doesn't seem to hit particularly hard against my Voidwalker, and his health isn't exceptionally high, so killing him isn't too problematic if you can deal with the warriors.\n\nHaven't had any success 10H though, I die too fast to run into MCs but it seems like it's really hard not because of impossible raid mechanics (Chimaeron), but because they just hit too hard for a 559 clothie to handle.\n\nEDIT: 564 now, and even when duoing with a 523 Prot Warr we still can't kill him 10H. The bone warriors just hit for such a ridiculous amount, and if even one breath or spark hits them before they go down, might as well throw yourself into the lava. It's doable, just not worth the immense effort required. One advice I can give for those who try, however, is to burn defensive CDs in phase 2. It [i]really[/i] hurts compared to normal mode, and it's where a lot of our wipes happened.\n\nEDIT 2: I haven't soloed it since 6.0 but I would imagine that it would be easy now. The adds would get AoE'd down super fast, and even if they get ignited back up then they will still die fast. Mind controls won't be a problem when you can easily pull over 1 million DPS on burst classes, neither will any of the mechanics. Lava phase may still hurt.

I started by burning Onyxia down (but no cds, just burn her), then the first set of adds disappear (no need to hurt them).\n2. Get some damage on Nefarian while you can until the lava rises. Be near a pillar before the lava so you can get out quickly.\n3. Get on the pillar quickly, then blow up the add on the pillar if you want.* Try to get some healing in during this part.\n4. Once the lava goes down, get off the pillar or the adds will destroy you with throwing knives or something.\n5. Get some damage on Nefarian while you can, building up fury (or whatever resource your class uses). Put some dots on the other pillar adds if you want. Try to be at full health before the adds come out.\n6. When all the adds come out, blow every aoe cd you have and focus them. Don't even worry about Nefarian, just blow the adds to hell as fast as possible. Use any kind of defensives or healthstones/pots during this phase. Edit: Tried it again this week, and I found that using the Wrathguard with Threatening Presence turned on really helps this phase.\n7. Move out of purple, but quickly return to killing adds.\n8.

Or ice, or steel, or whatever you have handy.\n\n[small]*I jumped onto the first pillar to start the fight and left a demonic circle up.
