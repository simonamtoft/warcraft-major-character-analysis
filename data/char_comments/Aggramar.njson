Flame Rend is pretty awful\u2013 it's a knockback that, if you're the only one there, is impossible to dodge and will immediately wipe you as it shoots you right off the platform. Aggramar turns to wherever you are when he casts it, and he can cast it multiple times in a row.\r\n\r\nHow I got through that particular ability was by using Blink and Mirror Image, and trying to kill him as fast as possible while ignoring all other mechanics/damage (120 with 440 ilevel, ymmv). On my successful attempt this is what happened:\r\n\r\nFirst, I blew as much DPS as I possibly could in the very beginning of the fight and he didn't cast Flame Rend at all. (On other attempts he did cast it in the first phase so again, ymmv.) It was after he summoned the flame adds that he finally cast Flame Rend and as soon as I went flying I Blinked and was back on the platform. Then he cast it right away again and I cast Mirror Image and got away from his front as fast as I could and just kept DPSing him down. And then he cast it [i]again[/i] but the Mirror Images were still up. Blink is great but it has a 15 second cooldown and I don't know how many times Aggramar can cast Flame Rend in a row but it's at least three.

Threat is very important on this fight because you want your pet tanking the boss at all times.\nI used a [pet=45] because of their [spell=264663] and [spell=264667], though any Ferocity pet should do the job.\n\nI used [spell=264667] right on pull with [spell=34477] on the pet. Watch your threat meters at all times so that you don't take aggro off him. I was slowing down on damage every time I would get close to 40% threat to be safe. Keep using MD on CD so that you can safely cast a few DPS spells in that short window. The whole reason we don't want aggro on us is that Aggramar uses [spell=243431] on any melee attacks and it stacks up really fast. This won't affect your pet however.\n\nTry to stay somewhere behind Aggramar at a far distance so that you don't get knockback off the platform by [spell=247079] when he reaches 100 energy. [i]At the event where this may happen, you might be able to cancel the knockback with [spell=781], although this may be tricky to do.[/i]\n \nDuring the intermissions where the boss goes immune, this is where you need to blow up the two big [npc=121985] adds. Let the small [npc=122532] reach the boss, this will give you one stack of [spell=244912] for each add. This does quite a bit of damage, so make sure you're actively DPSing the big adds so that you leech health off them. If you have a higher DPS than I did, you may want to save them until the small ones reach Aggramar so that you can DPS them instead of the boss for leech (otherwise you might take back the aggro from your pet). No point of saving turtle for the debuff, it will go through it.\n\nJust dodge any other mechanics and the fight should be relatively easy.\n\nIt took me 6:56 minutes, about 2 minutes away from enrage, to solo him. I was doing 20.5k DPS and 358 HPS.\n\nEDIT (much later on!): Was able to duo this boss fairly easily with a Shadow Priest friend, both 220+ ilvl, with me as a MM Night Fae instead of BM Venthyr and no Heart of Azeroth equipped.
